{"Topic":"Email Verification: A Brief Introduction \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nRunning a successful email campaign takes much more than a powerful message. You need to make sure you deliver the right message, to the right people, at the right time, and to the right email domain.\nEmail verification is an essential cog in the motion of any email engagement workflow. It is the process of validating the authenticity and accuracy of an email address before you send any messages to your ideal contacts.\nThere are many advantages to email verification, including:\nProtect the health and reputation of your email domain\nIncrease your email delivery rates and ensure your message reaches the right people in the right inboxes\nIdentify stale data before you message contacts on outdated or invalid email addresses that can harm your domain reputation and decrease your engagement rates\nReduce the risk of being flagged as SPAM\nRefer to the sections below for more information about how email verification tools work and what catch-all emails mean for your campaigns.\nBack to Top\nEmail Verification Tools\nMany people use email verification tools such as ZeroBounce, Mailfloss, Neverbounce, or Hunter to help protect their domain reputation and increase the performance of their email campaigns. However, if you use a third-party email verification tool in conjunction with Apollo, it can often be counterproductive to the success of your sequences.\nEvery third-party email verification tool has developed its own process to verify your emails. This means that the effectiveness or reliability of email verification relies greatly on the specific process of the tool you choose. Most competent tools include steps such as:\nA syntax check to ensure there are no typos or questionable characters in the email address\nA domain check to verify the existence of the domain name on which the email is hosted\nAn email ping to check that the specific email address exists\nAlthough these techniques can be effective, they can also greatly affect your coverage. For example, if an email service is temporarily unreachable when the verification tool checks its domain, you exclude all the emails from an organization in one swift check.\nFurthermore, the majority of popular email verification tools use a method called SMTP tickling.\nHold the Phone, What's that?\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) for sending messages. Most email verification tools leverage SMTP tickling to ask an email service if an email exists, thereby verifying its validity before you send any messages to it.\nSMTP tickling does not differentiate between valid and invalid \"catch-all emails\". Therefore, this method does not confirm if the email address will link you to the right person, or if your messages will be auto-dumped into a default inbox that no one will see.\nIt's Not All Doom and Gloom\nAlthough catch-all domains can still lead you to the right person; when you use third-party verification tools, is it very difficult to guarantee that they will. Hop into the Email Verification: The Apollo Process article to learn more about how Apollo's robust, built-in email verification process helps you to overcome this issue.\nFinally, it's important to note that a third-party tool is not an all-encompassing solution. Several factors impact your bounce rate, some of which email verification tools cannot help you with. For more information, refer to the \"Email Accuracy\" section of the \"Email Verification: The Apollo Process\" article.\nRead on to find out more about what catch-all emails are and why they matter.\nBack to Top\nCatch-All Emails\nCatch-all emails are the email addresses that belong to a catch-all mail server. This means that if you send an email to any address that belongs to a specific domain name\u2014even if the address does not exist, or is written incorrectly\u2014the catch-all mail server accepts your email.\nIt's Polyonymous!\nYou may have heard of the terms \"accept-all emails\" or \"wildcard email aliases\" too. Fear not, observant souls\u2014catch-all emails go by many names but the same definition applies to them all.\nHere's an example of how catch-all emails can be problematic for your campaigns:\nDomain Name Existing Email Addresses from Example Domain Catch-All Inbox Invalid Email Address \nexampledomain.com\tbob@exampledomain.com, jane@exampledomain.com, craig@exampledomain.com, tim@exampledomain.com\tinfo@exampledomain.com\tterry@exampledomain.com\t\nYou have an email for Terry at Example. His email is terry@exampledomain.com. However, Terry stopped working at Example 1 month ago and the company is yet to replace him. Example has 4 existing employee email addresses, plus 1 catch-all email address. This means that even though Terry left the company and his email address is no longer valid, the message you send to terry@exampledomain.com will land in the catch-all info@exampledomain.com inbox.\nCatch-all email servers exist so that important emails still reach a company inbox, despite sender errors. For this reason, a large number of companies have a catch-all email server. However, with the rise in spammers taking advantage of catch-all email domains, only some companies still dedicate resources to keep on top of reviewing the emails in their catch-all inboxes.\nIn short, if no one checks this catch-all inbox regularly, chances are the emails that land there won't be seen by anyone, let alone opened or read by the specific person you are trying to reach.\nBack to Top\nApollo-Verified Emails\nThird-party email verification tools sometimes flag Apollo-verified emails as invalid. This is because most tools cannot distinguish between valid and invalid catch-all emails.\nMany of the business emails from contacts that you prospect in Apollo could have a catch-all domain. This means that when you rely on third-party email verification tools\u2014unless you are willing to invest hours and hours manually verifying which catch-all emails are valid\u2014you will most likely rule out all catch-all emails from your lists. When you do so, you risk losing a big chunk of the potentially qualified company domains in your pipeline.\nHowever, there is a much easier, more accurate alternative. Apollo already includes a built-in email verification process with a 91% email accuracy rate that can differentiate between valid and invalid catch-all emails. This means that you do not need to use a third-party verification tool alongside Apollo. Instead, when you rely upon Apollo's verified emails you know that you automatically include the valid catch-all domains in your sequences and exclude the invalid ones. As a result, you are better equipped to reach more of your ideal contacts without putting your domain reputation at risk.\nBack to Top\nNext Steps\nNow that you have learned more about email verification tools and catch-all emails, jump into the Email Verification: The Apollo Process article to find out more about Apollo's verification process, why it is different, and what it means for the success of your email campaigns.\nBack to Top"}
{"Topic":"How Apollo Verifies Emails \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nIf you've used an email verification tool like Neverbounce, Zerobounce, Briteverify, or another similar tool, you may wonder why they sometimes flag Apollo-verified emails as unverifiable. In a nutshell, here's why:\nMost third-party tools can identify if a domain is active. Some can confirm if a domain is catch-all. But very few can detect at the mailbox level whether a specific email address from a catch-all domain exists or not.\nThis is because the majority of popular tools use a method called SMTP tickling.\nHold the Phone, What's that?\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) for sending messages. Most email verification tools leverage SMTP tickling to ask an email service if an email exists, thereby verifying its validity before you send any messages to it.\nSMTP tickling cannot differentiate between valid and invalid emails from a catch-all domain. Therefore, this method cannot confirm if the email address does exist and will link you to the right person or if your messages will be auto-dumped into a default inbox that no one will see.\nCatch-all domains can still lead you to qualified contacts. However, when you use most third-party verification tools it's very difficult to guarantee they will. No one wants to gamble with your domain reputation. Hence the catch-22 dilemma: include these emails in your email outreach and you put your domain at risk. Leave them out and you risk losing a chunk of potentially qualified leads.\nUnless you use Apollo. We do things differently.\nWhat Apollo Does Differently\nAt Apollo, we have a built-in email verification process with a 91% accuracy rate that does not rely solely on SMTP tickling to validate emails. Our 7-step email verification process can differentiate between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains. This means that when you send an email to an Apollo-verified contact with a catch-all domain, your email will land in the right inbox.\nFeeling skeptical?\nWe feel you. You don't want to put your domain at risk\u2014and quite rightly too. Remember though\u2014your success is our success. We value every one of our Apolloers and do not gamble with your reputation. Check out the FAQs below or reach out to our friendly support team to discuss any concerns you may have.\nSo what makes us different from other verification tools? As a B2B database provider, lead data is the bread and butter of Apollo's business. Providing accurate data and verifying emails is integral to the success of all Apollo users. To maintain the highest level of data consistency and accuracy, Apollo has a 7-step email verification process in place. This process takes advantage of Apollo's large datasets.\nApollo Datasets\nApollo collects and verifies data against multiple data sources to identify the best source of truth. Data sources include, but are not limited to:\nThe Apollo data contributor network\nPublic data crawling\nCarefully vetted third-party data providers\nBy running checks against our large datasets, Apollo effectively verifies emails in real time, handles catch-all domains, predicts email bounces, and automatically cleans emails. Third-party email verification tools cannot leverage such insights to gain the same level of accuracy and granularity when verifying emails\u2014especially when they are from catch-all domains.\nThe 7-Step Apollo Process\nApollo goes one step further than most verification tools to confirm that an account may or may not exist,\nMany users email prospects daily through Apollo to find and contact qualified leads and track the deliverability and success of their sequences. This means that Apollo does not only use advanced technologies to run syntax, domain, and email checks to determine the validity of each email. Apollo also leverages its insightful data to check and confirm if a real person is actively using an email. Within the 7-step email verification process, Apollo can:\nCheck and validate emails against Apollo-connected inboxes, CRMs, and CSV uploads\nTrack email delivery statistics\nMonitor email bounce-rates\nTherefore, when you request and spend 1 credit on a verified email in Apollo, you can be sure of 2 important points:\nApollo can provide greater email coverage for contacts vs. third-party email verification services because we do not eliminate a valid email just because it belongs to a catch-all domain.\nApollo has gathered ample evidence that the email does exist and will reach an actual person's inbox\nCurious about Credits?\nFor more information about how credits work in Apollo, please refer to the \"What Are Credits?\" article.\nBack to Top\nFollow Email Best Practices\nNow that you have read about the Apollo verification process and know why you may encounter conflicting results between Apollo-verified data and third-party verification tools, it's time to address the elephant in the room: Sending messages to verified emails is essential, but it's only one part of the magic potion. Even the best verification tool is not an all-encompassing solution. Several factors impact your bounce rate, including low open rates and recipients flagging your emails as SPAM.\nIf you want to make sure you're doing everything you can to keep your domain healthy and improve your deliverability rates when sending emails through Apollo, feast your eyes on these resources:\nApollo's Cold Email Deliverability Checklist\nAvoid SPAM Filters\nWhy Do I See Such a High Bounce Rate for Emails from Apollo?\nMore questions Running Through Your Magnificent Mind?\nWe know. There's a lot to take in. If you still have questions, hop on down to the FAQ section below and skip straight to the answers you're looking for.\nBack to Top\nFAQS\nWhat Does Catch-All Mean?\nA catch-all email server is set up to accept every email sent to that domain\u2014even if the email address does not exist.\nIt's Polyonymous!\nYou may have heard of the terms \"accept-all emails\" or \"wildcard email aliases\" too. Fear not young padawan\u2014catch-all emails go by many names but the same definition applies to them all.\nHere's an example of how unverified catch-all emails can be problematic for your campaigns:\nDomain Name Existing Email Addresses from Example Domain Catch-All Inbox Invalid Email Address \nexampledomain.com\tbob@exampledomain.com, jane@exampledomain.com, craig@exampledomain.com, tim@exampledomain.com\tinfo@exampledomain.com\tterry@exampledomain.com\t\nYou have an email for Terry at Example. His email is terry@exampledomain.com. However, Terry stopped working at Example 1 month ago and the company is yet to replace him. Example has 4 existing employee email addresses, plus 1 catch-all email address. This means that even though Terry left the company and his email address is no longer valid, the message you send to terry@exampledomain.com will land in the catch-all info@exampledomain.com inbox.\nWith the rise in spammers taking advantage of catch-all email domains, only some companies still dedicate resources to keep on top of reviewing the emails in their catch-all inboxes. If you send a message to an invalid email from a catch-all domain and your message lands in an inbox that no one checks regularly, it's unlikely anyone will see it. It's even less likely the specific person you are trying to reach will open or read it. This can lead to lower open rates and over time, can affect your domain reputation.\nHowever, many companies have a catch-all email server because they allow important emails to reach a company inbox, despite sender errors. So let's say Terry never left the company and his email does still exist. If you don't email him, you'll miss out on a potential deal just because his email address belongs to a catch-all domain.\nLuckily, at Apollo, we can distinguish between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains. Refer to the What Apollo Does Differently section above for more info.\nBack to Top\nWhy Do Third-Party Tools Flag Apollo-Verified Emails as Unverifiable?\nIn short, as lead data is the bread and butter of Apollo's business, we can collect and verify data against multiple data sources that third-party verification tools cannot. We do not solely rely on SMTP tickling to verify if a mailbox exists, which means we can distinguish between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains when other verification tools cannot. As a result, many third-party tools flag valid, Apollo-verified emails as unverifiable because they belong to a catch-all domain.\nFor a more detailed explanation, refer to the first half of this article.\nBack to Top\nDo I Need a Third-Party Email Verification Tool to Verify My Apollo Emails?\nYou do not. Apollo has an advanced, built-in, 7-step verification process with a 91% accuracy rate.\nProviding accurate data and verifying emails is integral to the success of all Apollo users, and we are committed to your success.\nFor more information on our verification process, refer to the 7-Step Apollo Process section above.\nBack to Top\nHow Do I Keep My Domain Healthy?\nStart by watching and implementing the tips from the webinar below into your outreach strategy. In this video, you'll learn fundamental steps to increase email deliverability, keep your domain safe, and avoid the dreaded SPAM folder.\nBack to Top\nWhat Does a 91% Accuracy Rate Actually Mean?\nJustice Bounces Back!\nFear not, for fair play reigns free at Apollo! If you send an email to an Apollo-verified contact within 30 days of requesting the details and the email bounces, Apollo refunds your email credit. For more information, please refer to the \"Check Your Email Credit Refunds\" section of the \"What Are Credits?\" article.\nApollo-verified emails have an accuracy rate of 91%. Although it may be impossible to eradicate invalid emails entirely from your prospecting workflow, many factors contribute to Apollo's 9% bounce rate. Due to our thorough, tried-and-tested verification process, invalid emails make up a very small portion of that percentage. Other factors include:\nIf the recipient has configured their email settings to block incoming emails\nIf the recipient's mailbox is full\nIf the recipient's server is temporarily unresponsive\nIf you have a negative email domain reputation.\nTo keep track of your sequences in Apollo, make sure you leverage email analytics to monitor email performance and run A\/B tests to keep improving your open, click, and response rates. You can also take advantage of the sequence diagnostics tool to pinpoint any issues with your domain.\nLooking For Email Tips?\nFor inspiration on how to increase your conversion rates, refer to the \"How Do I Write Effective Sales Emails?\" article for a brief introduction.

Bear with us; it won't be long until you can see and use the updated version.\nThere are 5 standard email status filters in Apollo:\nLikely to engage\nVerified\nUnverified\nUpdate required\nUnavailable\nThere is also an advanced user-managed filter you can activate.

For more information about how to use filters in Apollo, refer to the Search Filters Overview article.\nRefer to the sections below for further details about each email status filter.\nBack to Top\nEmail Status\nEmail Status Description Additional Information Credits \nLikely to engage\tA verified, valid, and active email address.\tApollo has recently or frequently detected activity that suggests the contact is active. Therefore, they are more likely to engage with your emails.\tSafe-to-send, verified emails cost 1 credit per contact.\t\nVerified\tA fully confirmed, valid email address. When you request a verified email, Apollo saves the data to your account.\tThis includes emails you manually edited or uploaded that Apollo knows to be verified. At Apollo, verified emails maintain an email match rate of 84% and an accuracy rate of more than 90%. For more information, please read How Apollo Verifies Emails.\tVerified emails cost 1 credit per contact. Although very rare, if an Apollo-verified email bounces within 30 days of you purchasing it, Apollo automatically refunds the credit to your account.\t\nUnverified\tThis includes emails Apollo was unable to verify that you or your team have manually edited, imported via a CSV file, uploaded from your CRM, or created via the Apollo API. It also includes emails where Apollo has low confidence in their validity.\tPlease note that if Apollo cannot verify the emails you edit or upload, Apollo marks them as unverified. If you want Apollo to validate a contact's unverified email, you can choose to enrich the email. For more information about Apollo enrichment, please refer to the Enrich section of the Apollo KB.\tYou can upload new contacts or edit saved emails at no cost.

For this reason, there may be instances where you need to show search results for people for which Apollo has a verified email.

{"Topic":"Prospect with Personal and Business Emails \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nApollo categorizes emails into 2 types:\nBusiness: The email address that a contact uses specifically for work purposes. For example: contactnameexample@apollo.io.\nPersonal: The email address that a contact uses for private affairs outside of working hours. For example: contactnameexample252@gmail.com.\nBy default, Apollo sets your primary email to a business email address. However, factors such as your industry, ideal customer profiles, and campaign objectives often dictate the type of email address that best fits your prospecting needs. For example, if you are in the recruiting industry, you are more likely to need a contact's personal email. If you sell to a B2B market, you are more likely to engage with a contact through their business email.\nGDPR Has the Last Word!\nYou can't access the personal emails of contacts from the EU, UK, and Switzerland due to GDPR restrictions. Keep calm and keep compliant.\nRefer to the sections below to find out how to change your primary email type and how to access a contact's personal email when you use Apollo's search.\nBack to Top\nChange Your Primary Email Type\nIf you are not an admin, you cannot access the necessary settings to change your primary email type. Please contact your Apollo admins for help.\nIf you are an admin, you can change your primary email at any time. However, Apollo only applies the new primary email type to the net new contacts that you request. Apollo does not change the primary email for any existing saved contacts. This means you can change your email type without disrupting the contacts that you already enrolled in a sequence.\nMap It Out!\nIf you integrated your Apollo account with Salesforce or HubSpot, carefully consider which email type you set as primary. Apollo uses the primary email address when mapping a contact\u2019s data to your CRM. Apollo cannot map secondary emails to a CRM.\nTo change your primary email:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Prospecting Config.\nFind the Primary Email Address section. Here, you have 3 options: Business, Personal, or Any. \nClick the email type that you want to set as primary. Then, click Save. \nEmails Galore!\nIf you select Any, Apollo still sets a contact's business email as the default. However, if Apollo finds both business and personal emails for a contact, you receive both. In this scenario, Apollo only charges you 1 credit for the 2 emails. \nFor more information about email credit charges, refer to Will Apollo Charge Me For More than One Email Per Contact?.\nYou have now updated your primary email. It can take up to 10 minutes for your changes to reflect in your prospecting system.\nBack to Top\nChange Your Primary Email Type in the Apollo Chrome Extension\nYou can also change your primary email type directly within the Chrome extension. To do so:\nOpen the Chrome extension icon on the right side of a website, then click the Settings icon. \nAccess the Settings tab. Then, select an option from the Primary Email drop-down. \nYou have now updated your primary email from within the Chrome extension.\nBack to Top\nAccess a Contact's Personal Email\nIf you set your primary email as Personal or Any, you can access all verified email addresses for a contact for 1 credit. Assuming Apollo finds a contact's verified personal email address, you can view it from that contact's profile page.\nWe Have Priorities!\nWhen you add a contact to a sequence, Apollo always uses the primary email address. Apollo only displays the secondary email if it can find a verified primary email.\nTo access email addresses for a contact:\nLaunch Apollo and click Search > People.\nApply filters to refine your search. \nIf your primary email type is Personal, you can only filter by email status in the Saved tab. If your primary email type is Business, you can filter by email Status in both the Saved and Net New tabs. \nClick the Net New tab. Then, click the name of the contact from which you want to access information. \nClick Access Email & Phone Number on the contact's profile page. \nApollo verifies the data and displays the personal email on the contact's profile page. \nLet's Get Personal!\nIf you set your primary email as Personal and Apollo can only find a verified business email for a given contact, Apollo does not save the business email or charge you any credits. \nIf you set your primary email as Any, Apollo prioritizes a verified business email, but also displays the verified personal email on the contact's profile page. Apollo only charges 1 credit per contact and displays all the verified email addresses it finds. \nFor more information, refer to Will Apollo Charge Me for More Than One Email per Contact?.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Email Sending Limits Overview \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Watch the Video\nWhat Are Sending Limits?\nSending limits are the maximum number of emails your email service provider (ESP) allows you to send from your mailbox per day and hour.\nEmail Service Provider Limits\nApollo does not send emails on your behalf. When you use Apollo for engagement, you send emails via a mailbox connected to Apollo. You can link multiple email providers to your Apollo account, including Gmail and Microsoft, among others. Every ESP monitors sent emails to ensure you are an individual emailing other individuals.\nThey each have their own daily and hourly sending limits. However, there are additional unpublished limits based on a variety of factors, including:\nThe age of your mailbox\nThe recipients receiving your emails\nThe type of content in your messages\nThe number of spam reports you've received\nTo maintain a healthy email deliverability rate and keep your domain safe, you should aim to keep your email activity as close to average as possible. The average person does not send more than 50 emails a day\u2014even when they're incredibly active via email.\nApollo Sending Limits\nSending limits in Apollo act as an additional safety net to help you adhere to best practices and prevent your ESP from suspending or limiting your email account.\nFeeling Limited?\nWant to increase the emails you send but don't want to put your reputation on the line? Apollo allows you to connect multiple mailboxes to increase the total volume of emails you send per day without putting your domain at risk.\nTo gain more control over the number of emails your team sends via a mailbox connected to Apollo, configure sending limits within Apollo. To keep your email account safe, Apollo advises staying within our recommended limits.\nLess Is So Much More!\nThe email sending science is simple. In general, the lower you set your sending limits, the better your deliverability rates will be. Although you have the flexibility to edit your sending limits in Apollo for each connected mailbox, we do not recommend increasing your limits beyond 50 emails per day. You raise them at your own risk. If you already have a bad domain reputation, you must lower your sending limits immediately.\nRefer to the sections below to access and edit your sending limits for a connected mailbox in Apollo, learn about recommended limits, and jump into related faqs.\nReady to Face Your Spam Fears?\nGot spam filters on the mind? Sneak a peek at the Avoid Spam Filters article for the best practices to keep your domain safe before you enroll contacts into your sequences.\nBack to Top\nEdit Sending Limits in Apollo\nTo access and edit sending limits:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Mailboxes.\nApollo displays the daily and hourly limits for each connected mailbox. From here, you can visualize and track your progress towards your daily limits in Apollo. For example, if you set your limits to 50 for a connected mailbox and you've sent 35 emails via Apollo from that mailbox so far that day, Apollo displays 35\/50. \nOnly in Apollo\nPlease note, Apollo only tracks the emails you send via Apollo. Any emails you send directly from your mailbox outside of Apollo do not count towards your daily Apollo sending limits.\nTo change the limits, click the mailbox you want to edit. \nClick Set to default if you want to adhere to Apollo's recommended sending limits. \nThen, click Reset to default to confirm the change. Apollo automatically reverts all sending limits for the selected mailbox. \nTo manually make changes, edit the fields for daily and hourly limits and the minimum delay between emails. Then, click Save changes. \nResist Temptation!\nWe get it. You want to reach as many of your ideal prospects as possible\u2014without restrictions. But your reputation matters. If you overdo it, you risk getting flagged as spam. Nobody likes spam.\nWant to avoid suspension or sending limitations? Stick within the recommended limits, follow email deliverability best practices, and A\/B test your messaging to help keep that domain squeaky clean. If you experience deliverability issues, lower your sending limits immediately.\nHungry for more tips? Check out our webinar on mastering email deliverability.\n(Recommended) While you're here, configure an unsubscribe link to accompany your email signature. If you give recipients an alternative, they are less likely to flag your email as spam.\nWhen you reach your hourly or daily limit for a mailbox, Apollo pauses any scheduled emails until the next hour or day.\nDaily limits in Apollo are based on a rolling 24-hour period, not the calendar day. The period begins the moment you turn on a sequence. When you enroll contacts into a sequence, Apollo verifies the number of emails both sent and scheduled to dispatch within the current 24-hour period. Apollo then respects the specified sending limits and pauses any emails that exceed the limit until the next period. If you make any changes to your limits, this influences and determines how many emails Apollo will schedule for the next 24-hour period.\nEmail Provider Limits and Apollo\nPlease remember that Apollo does not send emails on your behalf. All the mail you send in Apollo is sent via your connected mailbox(es). Your email provider's daily and hourly limits include all emails you send from a mailbox. If you actively use your mailbox outside of Apollo, lower your limits in Apollo to keep your domain safe and avoid disruption to the other emails you send.\nBack to Top\nRecommended Sending Limits\nApollo strongly advises you start with the recommended mailbox setting of 50 emails per day, 6 per hour, and with a 600-second delay between emails.\nWhile the maximum number of emails you can send from a connected mailbox via Apollo is higher than this, you should start with 50 and monitor your email performance closely. If you notice any deliverability issues, lower your sending limits immediately.\nIf you need to increase email volume, add more mailboxes and do not increase your sending limits until you have established solid deliverability and domain reputation. If you consistently achieve a 5% or higher reply rate and you have a strong domain reputation, you can increase the number of emails you send per day. However, even then, please remember that higher sending limits often correlate with worse deliverability rates. You increase your sending limits at your own risk.\nIt's Not Just a Numbers Game!\nWhat you write is as important as who you write to, how many emails you send, and when. Read more about how to write effective sales emails here or watch this webinar for tips on mastering the cold email.\nTo send a higher volume of emails without putting your domain at risk:\nLink additional mailboxes. Each mailbox has its own sending limits. Depending on your plan, you can add up to 15 mailboxes per user. See the pricing page for more information.\nIntegrate with SendGrid or Mailgun. Apollo recommends you do this if you already actively use SendGrid or Mailgun for transactional or marketing emails related to your service or product. If you don't, consider using this Apollo partner to help follow deliverability best practices.\nWhy isn't Apollo sending out enough emails to hit my sending limit?\nYour Email Service Provider (ESP) sets sending limits, not Apollo. You can configure limits in Apollo to gain some control within the platform. However, if you try to set a large email-sending limit, your ESP might not allow it. ESPs manage this number natively and might automatically limit how many emails an account can send.\nBack to Top\nWhat Happens When I Hit My Limits In Apollo?\nIf you hit your daily or hourly sending limits, Apollo automatically places the remaining emails in the \"scheduled-delayed\" queue until the next day or hour.\nTo check the status of your emails:\nLaunch Apollo and click Emails.\nYou can view the status on the right of each email. If the status is \"scheduled-delayed,\" it is likely because you hit your sending limit. If so, Apollo sends the email the following hour or day when the limit refreshes.\nBehind Schedule?\nIf you see the \"scheduled-delayed\" status and haven't hit your sending limit, it is likely due to your sequence schedule. For more information on how schedules work in Apollo, refer to the Create and Edit Sequence Schedules article.\nBack to Top\nWhat Happens When My Email Provider Limits or Suspends My Account?\nIf your email service provider suspends or rate limits your email account, it means you've sent too much underperforming content or too many emails per day or hour. You should immediately lower your sending limits in Apollo, check the sequence stats, edit the email content of any messages that received a high bounce or spam-blocked rate, and follow any further instructions from your email provider to get back in their good graces.\nAdditional Resources:\nGuidelines to Avoid Spam Filters\nEmail Deliverability Checklist\nMastering Email Deliverability Webinar\nHow to Restore a Suspended Gmail Account\nIf your email service provider limits your account and you continue to hit their rate limits, they will suspend your account.

{"Topic":"Troubleshoot Search Filters \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nSearch filters are powerful parameters that allow you to include or exclude specific data when you search for people or companies and build lists in Apollo.\nReview the following sections for a few frequently asked questions about search filters.\nBack to Top\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat's the Difference Between the People and Companies Filters?\nFor a strategic approach, use company filters to find the businesses most likely to benefit from your product or service. Then, use people filters to find the best individuals to reach out to.\nCompany-specific filters allow you to search for companies with search results limited to businesses. You might examine companies you\u2019ve closed\/won and make assumptions about the companies you\u2019re most likely to have success with in the future. With these attributes, you can search Apollo to see how similar companies are performing through filters like company size, industry, location, funding, keywords, and more.\nPeople-specific filters allow you to search for individuals and employees, with search results limited to people. You can create personas based on your ideal customer profile. Then use personas in a search, combined with other filters like list and email status, to find the right person at the right companies for your message.\nWhen you\u2019ve found great prospects, save and add your contacts to sequences to begin your outreach.\nHow Do I Filter Search Results to Exclude Companies I\u2019ve Already Added to My Lists?\nTo exclude companies already on your lists:\nClick Search > Companies.\nClick the list filter > Advanced Settings and select lists under the Exclude dropdown.\nWhy Are There No Records When I Use the Date Refreshed in Apollo Filter?\nIf you don't see results, try expanding the refreshed date range. The date refreshed in Apollo filter allows you to search based on when contact data was last updated in Apollo.\nApollo makes updates available in real-time whenever it captures a data signal such as a job change or a new phone number or email. You can refresh data on saved contacts so your information stays accurate and up-to-date.\nHow Do I Find The Best Person to Email at Each Company?\nOnce you\u2019ve identified a promising company for outreach, search for people that work at the company with the persona filter. Personas allow you to target different groups of people with sets of titles, departments, and attributes that define your ideal customer profile. When combined with the company filter or the list filter, you can find the best person to email at each company.\nWith your search results, add them to a sequence to begin your outreach.\nHow Do I Filter for People Who Have Personal Email Addresses?\nBy default, when you save a contact in Apollo, you access their business email address.\nHowever, many factors, such as your industry, ideal customer profile, and campaign objectives may dictate your prospecting strategy. To change your default prospecting configuration to access personal email addresses instead of business email addresses, check out Prospect with personal emails.\nHow Do I Find the Phone Numbers of Contacts If I Already Know Their Email Addresses?\nWhen you request a contact\u2019s phone number, you also make a request for their email address. If you already know contact email addresses, upload your contacts via CSV. Next, use CSV enrichment to enrich your contact data with phone numbers without enriching emails.\nWhen you're ready, use the dialer to reach out and engage.\nWhich Filters Aren't Accessible from the Free Plan? How Do I Access Advanced Filters?\nSome Apollo plans include more filters than others. For updated pricing and availability, check out Apollo plans. To access advanced filters, upgrade your plan. If you have questions about upgrading, reach out to the Apollo sales team.\nYou can learn more about each filter in Search Filters Overview.\nHow Do I Filter for Contacts Outside of the US?\nTo filter for contacts outside of the US:\nClick Search > People > then use the location filter.\nEnter the United States and select Exclude.\nHow Do I Know Which Buying Topics are Best for Our Company?\nBuying intent topics are most effective when they're narrowly focused on your specific product and market. Use buying intent topics that best reflect the core product or service you offer. For instance, if you\u2019re a travel agent, you might search for \u201ctravel.\u201d\nNext, use more granular topics to reflect the use cases your product solves. Like \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d or \u201ctravel fraud.\u201d\nFinally, use buying intent topics about your competition, or about topics covering the pain points or challenges your customers see. Like \u201ctravel rewards\" or a competitor travel agency. The more specific and niche your topics are, the more effective your search will be.\nWith well-selected buying intent topics, you can gain valuable insight into your pipeline. When Apollo associates your prospects with multiple buying intent topics, you should prioritize them in your outreach as they indicate high relevance to your campaign.\nCheck out Buying Intent Overview to learn more about buying intent and intent topics.\nBack to Top"}
{"Topic":"Avoid Spam Filters \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Watch the Video\nOverview\nEmail Service Providers (ESPs) often have strict rules to protect users from unwanted or undesirable emails. To avoid these \"spam blockers\" you need to follow email best practices. If you do not, your emails may bounce and never reach your intended audience. This, in turn, puts your domain health at risk.\nRead on to learn how to avoid spam filters and improve email deliverability when you send emails via a mailbox connected to Apollo.\nLet's (Not) Bounce\nPlease note that the guidelines below are only best practices. They are not guaranteed to eliminate all bounces or instances of spam-blocked emails. Spam filtering is user-specific\u2014if someone marks an email as spam, their email service provider's spam filtering will update itself to catch similar emails in the future. Two people can receive the same email and encounter different filtering behavior.\nBack to Top\nEmail Deliverability Best Practices\nFeeling Overwhelmed and Not Sure Where to Start?\nWe feel you! Staying clear of spam filters can be pretty daunting. If you're short on time and want a quick summary, hop into our email deliverability checklist and follow the best practices to improve your email deliverability rates.\nAt a high level, there are 2 primary causes for email bounces and ESPs marking emails as spam:\nDomain reputation\nEmail content and formatting\nBack to Top\nDomain Reputation\nFor a better chance of avoiding spam filters, follow the steps below to configure your domain settings.\nSet Up the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for Your Sending Domains\nWelcome-listing your domain improves your deliverability and ISP reputation. You should configure the following domain attributes to help raise your spam score.\nSet Up SPF Records: An authorization method that specifies which email servers can send and receive emails on behalf of your organization.\nSet Up DKIM Policies: An authentication method that uses cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt emails sent to and from your organization. It also prevents in-transit altering of sent or received messages.\nSet Up DMARC Policies: An authentication method that specifies how to handle emails that don't pass SPF and\/or DKIM checks. DMARC also generates reports to prevent email spoofing.\nMaster of Your Domain (Providers)\nThe information you need to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM is specifically related to your domain and is not related to Apollo. Apollo doesn't have email servers. All emails are sent directly from your email provider. Instructions to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM vary by domain provider. Contact your domain provider to obtain this information and receive any support you need.\nWhen you have configured SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, consider implementing the following:\nSet Up a New Domain\nThis domain should be different from your primary sending domain and you should only use it to send marketing emails. Additionally, this means you can create new mailboxes from this domain and add and replace them in Apollo for each user profile. For more information on how to connect mailboxes to Apollo, refer to the Link Your Mailbox to Apollo.io article.\nSet Up a New Tracking Domain\nA tracking domain is a secondary (or sub) domain name related to your original domain. It allows Apollo to redirect a tracking pixel added to emails to track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.\nTracking pixels are often flagged as spam. Tracking domains redirect the attention of the email from your main domain and will help with deliverability.\nFollow these instructions to set up a new tracking subdomain.\nTighten Up Tracking Domains\nOn occasion, you may find that a server flags your domain as spam. If this happens, you can spin up a new one with the tracking subdomain. Make sure you follow the same instructions to create a new tracking subdomain with a different name to reset your deliverability if needed.\nEmail Content and Formatting\nRemove Links from the Body of Your Email: Spam filters look for links, especially in first-contact emails. Ensure you've removed links from your signature and in the body of your emails.\nRemove Images from the Body of Your Email: Images or attachments, especially in automated or first-contact emails, can activate spam blockers and cause bounces. Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for step 3 or later in sequences once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\nDon't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text: Spam blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\nKeep Your Paragraphs Concise: Lengthy content can activate spam blockers or cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\nAvoid Words that Trigger Spam Filters: Spam filters are constantly evolving. As a result, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. Try to communicate in a professional, personable way. Avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself. For further recommendations, refer to Avoid Spam Triggers in Your Email Content.\nA\/B Test Your Messaging: Always test your messaging to see what works best. You can A\/B test in Apollo to try multiple versions of a message. If one version has a higher bounce rate, compare the differences to understand the cause.\nBack to Top\nAdditional Considerations\nStill having issues with spam-blocked emails? Here are some additional steps you can take:\nConnect Apollo to a SendGrid or Mailgun Account: SendGrid and Mailgun are mass emailing services that use their own email servers. They also replace the tracking URLs and direct them to their servers to resolve deliverability issues. If you already use SendGrid or Mailgun, you can integrate your account with Apollo. If you do so, you do not need to configure a tracking subdomain. SendGrid and Mailgun manage your tracking links on their end. \nFor Old-Timers Only!\nPlease note, Apollo only recommends integrating with your SendGrid or Mailgun account if you already actively use their platform for transactional or marketing emails related to your service or product. If you don't, consider using this Apollo partner to help you follow deliverability best practices.\nClick here for more info on the SendGrid integration or here for more on the Mailgun integration. \nThere Can Only Be One (Tracking Link)\nIf you've connected your Apollo account to SendGrid or Mailgun and your emails are flagged as spam, you may need to replace the tracking link within your SendGrid or Mailgun account. Both platforms provide a feature that functions like Apollo's tracking subdomain. For more info and support on deliverability with your SendGrid or Mailgun account, refer to this help article for SendGrid or this support article for Mailgun.\nInclude an Unsubscribe Link in Your Email Signature: Customize the text in an opt-out link from your email settings. Apollo then automatically adds the link with your signature on all of the emails you send via mailboxes connected to Apollo. Recipients are more likely to click an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as spam. When a recipient unsubscribes, it does not affect your overall sending reputation. If they mark you as spam, it does. For more info on how to configure your unsubscribe link, refer to this article.\nUpdate Apollo Send Limits: Head to Settings, click You, and then click the Mailboxes tab. Click a mailbox and consider lowering the sending limits to 50 emails per day with a delay of 90s between each email. For more info, refer to the Email Sending Limits Overview article. Want to follow best practices but need to send more emails? You can link more mailboxes to send a higher volume of emails without putting your domain at risk. \nOnly Send Messages to Contacts with Verified Emails: Use the email status filter and the date refreshed in Apollo filter when prospecting. You should only add contacts with valid, up-to-date emails into your sequences. \nStop, in the Name of Accuracy!\nIf a contact with a verified email spam blocks you, it doesn't mean the email address is inaccurate. It means the contact likely exists and your email was either automatically or manually marked as unfit or inappropriate for delivery.\nBack to Top\nJoin Us in Our Sales Community!\nAre you a diehard Apollo fan who\u2019s passionate about sharing and learning industry-leading sales tactics from members of our sales community?

{"Topic":"Buying Intent Overview \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nBuying intent helps you engage with the right prospects from the right companies at the right time. With timely insights into the online intent-to-buy behaviors of your ideal customer profiles, buying intent allows you to easily identify the solutions and products that your target markets are actively researching online.\nOnce you have identified your ideal customer profiles in Apollo, you can use buying intent to visualize key online behavior, filter by the ideal companies with the highest intent scores for your selected topics, and prioritize your pipeline accordingly.\nPlan Your Topics and Filters\nYour access to buying intent topics and search filters depends on your Apollo plan. Refer to Apollo's pricing page for more details.\nThe following sections details how Apollo calculates and sources buying intent, and the different intent topics available to you.\nBack to Top\nUnderstand Intent Signals\nApollo partners with buying intent data providers Bombora and LeadSift (a Foundry company) to provide buying intent signals. For more information about how these Apollo partners collect intent data, please refer to Bombora's intent data overview and Foundry'sintent data product information.\nTo utilize buying intent signals in Apollo, you must first select intent topics. These are the different keywords and competitors that you are targeting. When a company actively searches for 1 of your selected intent topics, this triggers an intent signal. Apollo captures and updates intent signals weekly. Based on the frequency, trend, and recency that these intent signals fire, Apollo calculates intent score for companies.\nBack to Top\nIntent Topics\nIntent topics are products and services that prospects actively research online across social media, company websites, job boards, news sites, and other sources. It can be a keyword or even competitor names.\nIn Apollo, you can choose from over 14,000 intent topics from Bombora, and over 1,600 intent topics from LeadSift within 110 broader categories such as 3D software, sales, and financial services. Refer to Intent Topics for a complete list of available topics.\nYou can find powerful granularity when searching at the intent topic level in Apollo. This means that you can apply the specific intent topics that best fit your market, even if it is very niche.\nFor example, if you are in the development tools industry, you could apply something granular to your search such as \"artificial neural network software,\" \"cookie and website tracker scanning software,\" or \"augmented reality SDK software,\" to name just a few of your available options.\nBack to Top\nIntent Scores\nApollo uses data from Bombora and LeadSift to calculate intent scores. This score indicates the strength of a company's buying intent. A higher intent score indicates a contact is more likely to engage with your company and convert into paying customers.\nWhen Bombora provides an intent topic, Apollo utilizes the accompanying intent score that is placed in a range of 0-100. Apollo considers scores from 0-61 to be low, 62-75 to be mid, and 75-100 to be high.\nWhen LeadSift provides an intent topics, Apollo's proprietary algorithm calculates intent scores based on the following components:\nFrequency: How often is a company searching for a particular topic with intent? For example, a company triggers 3 signals within the last 3 months.\nTrend: Has there been an upward or downward trend in the search for a particular intent topic over the last 30 days in comparison to the previous 30 days?\nRecency: When was the last time a company searched for the intent topic? For example, the intent score could be different if the most recent search was 1 week ago or 1 month ago.\nApollo considers each of these components when giving the company a score based on LeadSift's data, and then groups the scores into the following categories:\nHigh: A company triggers at least 4 intent signals in the last 90 days or demonstrates an upward trend with at least 2 intent signals in the last week.\nMedium: A company triggers at least 2 intent signals in the last 90 days and at least 1 intent signal in the last 2 weeks.\nLow: A company triggers at least 1 intent signal in the last 90 days.\nIf both Bombora and LeadSift provide data for an intent topic, Apollo chooses the higher score between the 2 sources.\nBack to Top\nUse Buying Intent\nReady to leverage buying intent?

{"Topic":"Track Website Visitors to Prioritize Prospects \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nThe website visitors feature enables you to track the accounts that have visited your websites. This means you can uncover the names of companies that have generated activity on the domains you choose to track and filter them based on when they visited and how engaged they are in the buying process.\nUsing Apollo to track your website visitors reduces the need for your sales team to coordinate with your own IT and marketing teams to understand whether prospects are actively engaged with your websites. You can also use more search filters to further reduce the noise in your visitors data and target only your ideal prospects based on company information.\nRefer to the following sections to learn how to track your websites' visitors and view the related data in Apollo.\nBack to Top\nSet Up Tracking\nStep 0: Before You Begin\nApollo admins can complete the instructions provided in step 1 and step 3 of this article. Technical skills are not required.\nThe instructions in step 2 require either knowledge of HTML and a front-end language like JavaScript, along with access to your website's codebase, or access to a tool such as Google Tag Manager. If you or your team do not have access or the technical skills needed, work with your organization to arrange the necessary help.\nBack to Top\nStep 1: Add Website Domains\nTo add the websites that you want to track and find the Apollo JavaScript snippet:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Prospecting > Website visitors.\nClick Add Domain. \nEnter the URL for the website where you want to track traffic. \n(Optional) For the domain you added, open the Advanced Intent Settings drop-down to set the scoring criteria for your website visitors. Your scoring criteria establishes how important visits to specific website pages are to you, and helps you identify accounts showing a strong interest in your product when [viewing your website visitor data](#view-your-website-visitor-data). \nFor example, if you believe that visits to your pricing page represent a strong interest in your product, you might want to set Page URL to your pricing page's URL and Intent to High. \nClick Save.\nIn the Apollo Script section, click Copy Code. Do not attempt to copy or type the code manually. If you're not the one adding the code to your website, send the copied JavaScript snippet to the personnel responsible. \nIf you want to add more domains to track, click Add domain and repeat this process.\nOtherwise, you or your designated personnel can proceed to Step 2.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Add the JS Snippet to Your Website\nThere are 2 options for adding the JS snippet to your website: adding it directly to your website's code, or using Google Tag Manager.\nDirect\nAdd the JavaScript snippet generated in Step 1 to your website's code.\nThe snippet can either be inserted between the head tags of a website's HTML, or in the code for a specific page you want to track. The snippet should be included for every page that you want to track.\nWith the snippet added to your website, proceed to Step 3.\nGoogle Tag Manager\nHelping Hand\nIf you have never used Google Tag Manager and need help getting started, please refer to Google's Tag Manager documentation.\nTo utilize Google Tag Manager to add the JavaScript snippet generated in Step 1:\nGo to Google Tag Manager and log in to your account. Then, select the workspace that you want to use to manage this tag.\nClick Tags New to add a new tag. \nClick the pencil icon to edit the tag configuration, then select Custom HTML for the tag type. \nPaste the Apollo JS snippet into the HTML section. \nClick the pencil icon to edit the tag trigger, then choose which pages on your website should trigger the tag. Select All Pages to trigger the tag across your website. Then, click Save. \nTo publish the container, click Submit, then click Publish.\nYour tag is now added to Google Tag Manager. With the snippet added to your website, proceed to Step 3.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Test the Connection\nWith the JS snippet added to your website, you should test the connection to ensure that Apollo is able to capture and analyze the traffic from your added domain.\nTo test the connection:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Prospecting > Website visitors.\nClick Test connection to test all of your websites. If a domain's connection is good, the status will be Active. \nIf your connection is successful, it takes up to 24 hours for data to reflect in Apollo.

{"Topic":"Set up Look-alike Domains to Protect Your Primary Domain \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nSet up look-alike domains to protect your primary domain and improve email deliverability when you reach out to contacts via Apollo sequences.\nA look-alike, or cousin, domain is not the same as your company's primary operating domain. Automated systems do not see it as a match. Nonetheless, it is a domain that most casual observers affiliate with your primary domain. For example, if apollo.io is Apollo's primary domain, Apollo might choose to create a cousin domain like heyapollo.io or meetapollo.io.\nWhen you send cold emails from a look-alike domain, you help protect the sending reputation of your primary domain and eradicate the risk of negatively impacting the deliverability of your company's regular operational email.\nRefer to the following sections for the recommended steps when setting up look-alike domains for your cold outreach in Apollo.\nBack to Top\nStep 1: Set Up a New Domain\nTo set up a new look-alike domain:\nSet up a new domain with your domain provider:\nEvery domain provider has a different domain management interface. If you need help setting up a new domain, visit your domain provider's knowledge base.\nHere are some popular domain provider resources for guidance: \nAmazon Web Services (AWS)\nGoDaddy\nNamecheap\nCreate a new email address: When you have set up a new domain, you need to create a professional email address with your mailbox provider (MBP) using your new domain. For further guidance, please refer to your MBP's knowledge base.\nHere are some popular MBP help centers for support: \nMicrosoft 365\nGoogle Workspace\nFinalize the setup: Head to your domain provider and configure the settings to finalize the setup process.\nNow that you have a new look-alike domain, follow best practices to set your team up for success.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Follow Setup Best Practices\nBefore you link your mailbox to Apollo and begin your cold outreach, there are certain best practices to follow. Although a look-alike domain isolates your primary domain from the damage that poor targeting, content, and sending practices can have on your sending reputation, you should still follow best practices with your look-alike domain. It takes very little time to burn a sending reputation, and recovering or rebuilding it on another domain is a slow process.\nTo protect the reputation of your look-alike domain and optimize your sending efforts:\nDo not use more domains than necessary:\nWhen an MBP sees the same message coming from many different domains, it looks like snowshoe spamming. This is where a spammer spreads sends across multiple domains and IPs to avoid being caught.\nAllow your new domain to age:\nSpammers often register new domains and immediately start spamming through them. Almost all filtering systems will flag a domain as potential spam if it is less than a month old. Wait 30 days before you send any emails from this domain, and then begin sending emails slowly. Start by sending 10 emails daily and monitor open and click rates. After a few weeks, if your emails are performing well, slowly increase the number of emails you send. Remember not to exceed Apollo's recommended sending limits per mailbox.\nPublish a website on your domain:\nA simple landing page will suffice. Filters do automated vetting on a domain, including looking for a website. \nPlay It Safe\nPlease note, Apollo recommends that you don't forward traffic from your landing page to your main corporate site. You should also avoid including links or images that direct users back to your main domain. These tactics tie your domain reputations together and counteract the purpose of creating a look-alike domain for your cold outreach efforts.\nAvoid using DNS privacy:\nIt's common spammer practice to hide behind anonymized registrars. As a result, if you register your domain with anonymized contact information, servers are more likely to treat you as a spammer.\nFollow domain authentication best practices:\nWhitelabel everything to ensure all URLs in your messages and on your landing page link back to the look-alike domain and not your main domain.\nUse a custom tracking link at the domain.\nSet up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for the domain and ensure all links run through it.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Link Your New Mailbox to Apollo\nWhen you've set up your new look-alike domain, link the associated mailboxes to Apollo and follow the mailbox configuration steps.\nWhen you link the mailbox(es), make sure you configure:\nYour email signature.\nSending limits.\nOpt-out and open tracking.\nDomain authentication.\nNow you're ready to create and enroll contacts into your Apollo sequences. Just make sure you adhere to the following best sending practices when you do so.\nBack to top\nStep 4: Follow Sending Best Practices\nWhen you build your sequences in Apollo, follow best sending practices to optimize your campaigns for engagement.\nDon't link back to your primary domain from within your emails:\nAvoid linking to or including images hosted at your main corporate site. You must isolate the reputation of the look-alike domain from your primary domain. You don\u2019t want automated link followers to add your main corporate domain to the reputation that the sends from your look-alike domain generate.\nUse different email templates for each domain:\nIf you set up several look-alike domains and use the exact same messaging across each one, you risk aggregating your sending reputation across domains. This is because servers apply fingerprinting tactics to evaluate how recipients treat your messages. Data points include your domain and IP, the URLs in your messages, and the general structure of the messages you send. When you send the same message across multiple domains, you also risk being flagged for snowshoe spamming.\nAvoid \"batch and blast\" messages:\nOptimizing for engagement is key. Follow email best practices and avoid the common mistakes of inauthentic personalization. Resist the temptation of gathering a large list and bulk-sending all your contacts the same generic message. Instead, focus on clearly identifying your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), using search filters to segment your contacts, and enrolling them into sequences with highly targeted messaging that speaks to their specific goals and needs.\nAuto-assign emails in a sequence to increase your daily reach:\nWhen you add contacts to a sequence, select the auto-assign email toggle to rotate between the mailboxes you use to send your emails. Apollo then dynamically manages which email you send a message from based on the sending limits and availability of the selected mailboxes at the time of sending. \nDon't Mix and Match!\nFor each sequence, you should only select mailboxes from the same look-alike domain to avoid aggregating sending reputation across your domains.\nBack to Top"}
{"Topic":"Prospect with Territories \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Watch the Video\nOverview\nTerritories help you set clear guidelines and rules that restrict which contacts and accounts each user on your team can prospect. This helps you to better organize your sales team so they only engage with the specific contacts you assign to them.\nYou can use territories to filter and segment lists in numerous ways, not just to apply geographic restrictions. Refer to the following sections to create and assign territories.\nBack to Top\nAdd New Territories\nTo add a new territory:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Territories.\nClick New Territory. \nName the territory and assign it to a user group. If you choose the Specific users button, you need to select the users that you want to assign to the territory. \nClick Add filters for people and companies. \nTo define the territory, add as many search filters as you need. Then, click Save filters. \nClick Save to activate the territory. \nYou have now applied the newly created territory to your assigned audience. Repeat these steps to create more territories. There is no limit to how many you can create.\nBack to Top\nSearch Using Territories\nWhen you assign territories to users in your Apollo account, they cannot see, search, or access any contacts that fall outside the rules of those territories.\nWhen a user searches for new contacts or accounts in Apollo, the Territories search filter shows the territory you've assigned to them. Only Apollo admins can edit or delete this filter.\nContact Restrictions\nIf users search for a particular record in Apollo and can't see it, it's most likely because a territory restricts their view. To give them access to additional contacts that fall outside of their territory, you can either edit the rules for the territories assigned to them, or update their permission profile.\nBack to Top\nRestrict Prospecting by Account Owner Status\nIf you only want users at your company to prospect contacts from accounts they have been assigned, restrict their prospecting activities using territories. As an Apollo admin, build a territory that automatically applies to all of your assigned users and restricts their search in Apollo to the accounts they own, rather than building separate territories for each individual user.\nStart by adding a new territory and assigning it to a user group. When you select filters for the territory, click the Owner filter. Then, select Current User from the Account owner drop-down.\nWhen users with the assigned territory search for contacts, they will only see contacts from their own accounts.\nBack to Top\nRestrict Prospecting Using Custom Fields\nIf you assign account owners in Salesforce or HubSpot and sync that data to Apollo, use custom field entries to restrict prospecting activities by territory. This ensures users only prospect the accounts in Apollo that you have assigned to them in your CRM.\nCreate a Lookup - User Field\nStart by adding a new territory and assigning it to a user group. When you select filters for the territory:\nClick the Custom Fields filter and then click the Contact tab. Select Add Custom Field Filter and choose a custom field. The field must be a Lookup - User type field. \nFor Value, click the Is any of checkbox, then select the users from the drop-down. Make sure you add the same users that you assigned to the territory. \nClick Save filters and finish creating the territory.\nYou have now restricted prospecting with custom fields. When users with the assigned territory search for contacts, they will only see the records where the custom field you selected has a value that matches the user.\nBack to Top\nEdit Permission Profiles for Territories (Admins Only)\nIf you are an Apollo admin, you can edit permission profiles to add or remove user territory permissions. This enables you to control which users at your company can add new territories and prospect outside of their assigned territories.\nTo edit permission profiles, launch Apollo and click Settings > Permission Profiles. Then, follow the steps in Create and Assign Permission Profiles.\nIn the Prospecting permissions section, click the following checkboxes to give users more flexibility when prospecting:\nCan add or edit Territories & Territory Rules: This enables users to add and edit territories.\nCan prospect outside of assigned territories: This enables users to search for new contacts and accounts outside their assigned territories.\nBack to Top\nEdit Existing Territories\nTo edit an existing territory:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Territories.\nFind the territory and click ... Edit. \nFrom here, you can change the name, assigned users, and search filters that define the territory. \nClick Save to update the territory.\nYou have now edited an existing territory.\nBack to Top\nClone Territories\nIf you want to create a new territory based on an existing one, you can clone the original one. This enables you to assign a territory with some of the same characteristics to different audiences, such as sales reps that target the same persona across different locations.\nTo clone an existing territory:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Territories.\nFind the territory you want to clone, then click ... > Duplicate. \nName the new territory and assign it to a user group. If you choose the Specific users button, you need to select the users that you want to assign to the territory. \nThe filters from the cloned territory are still active. To update the search filters that define the territory, click Add filters for people and companies, then add and remove filters as needed. \nClick Save to create the new territory.\nYou have now activated your new territory.\nBack to Top\nDelete Territories\nTo delete a territory:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Territories.\nFind the territory you want to delete, then click ... > Delete. \nClick Delete again to confirm your decision.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Upload a CSV of Contacts to Apollo \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nYou may want to upload a CSV file of contacts to Apollo if:\nYou don't have a CRM or haven't connected your CRM with Apollo.\nYou have a list of contacts that you want to engage with and track in Apollo.\nYou have contacts that you want to add to a list in Apollo\nYou have contacts you want to save in Apollo first and then enrich with verified emails or phone numbers.\nEnrichment and Uploads Go Head-to-Head!\nPondering the difference between enriching a CSV file and uploading one? Let's take a closer look at both:\nCSV Uploads: Use this feature to save your contacts in Apollo and then take action on them, such as enroll them in a sequence, call them from the dialer, add them to an Apollo list, leverage conversation insights from any meetings you have with them, track your engagement with them through Apollo, and much more. When you upload your CSV file, Apollo matches the contact and enriches the record with missing data. Apollo does not enrich email or phone number fields when you upload a CSV file.\nCSV Enrichment: Use this feature to improve the overall data of the records in your CSV. You can choose from over 38 data points with which to enrich your records and then export the enriched CSV file. You can also choose to use credits to enrich the contacts' email and phone numbers if you want to. This feature does not save contacts to the Apollo database.\nRefer to the following sections for more information on how to correctly prepare your CSV, upload it into Apollo, and then apply the CSV to a search and engage or enrich the contacts with verified emails and phone numbers.\nBack to Top\nStep 0: Prepare Your CSV File\nBefore you import a CSV of contacts into Apollo:\nMake sure your file includes the following mandatory columns: \nFirst Name\nLast Name\nCompany\nCompany Website\nHowever, the more data you include in your CSV, the better. Apollo can then match the contact in the database and enrich the record with any missing information found. To further improve your chances of a match, Apollo recommends you include the contact email and\/or LinkedIn profile if you have it. \nOnly Have LinkedIn Data?\nPlease note, if you only have the URL to a contact's LinkedIn profile, Apollo doesn't recommend you import this data from a CSV. Instead, you can use the Apollo Chrome Extension to save the contact directly from their LinkedIn profile. For more information, please refer to the Apollo Chrome Extension Overview article.\nCheck that you have set the language settings in your PC to one of the following supported delimiters: \nComma (,)\nSemicolon (;)\nColon (:)\nPipe (|)\nIf you encounter any formatting issues when you upload your file, you likely need to change your default settings. For more information, refer to the How Do I Change the Default Delimiter on My Computer? FAQ.\nMake sure you convert your file to CSV format. Apollo does not currently support TSV files.\nSpecial CSV Column Circumstances\nIf your CSV file includes values that you want to map to a checkbox in Apollo, enter True for checked and False for unchecked.\nIf your CSV file includes a column featuring a multi-picklist field, you should separate each value in the cell with a semicolon.\nBack to Top\nStep 1: Upload a CSV of Contacts\nTo upload a CSV file of contacts into Apollo:\nLaunch Apollo and then click Search > People.\nClick Import > Bulk Import from CSV. \nClick Select CSV File in the Import contacts section. \nSelect your CSV file from your computer and then click Open to upload it. \nBack to Top\nStep 2: Map Your Columns\nNow you've uploaded your CSV file, you need to map each column header to the correct Apollo field.\nPsst...This Is Important!\nIf you want to pull the data from your CSV file into Apollo successfully, Apollo needs to know which fields to map your data to. So sit back, take a deep breath, and make sure you map correctly. And remember, you can only map one Apollo field to one column header. No more, no less. After all, nobody likes a data pickle!\nTo map your CSV column headers to the corresponding Apollo fields:\nUse the drop-down menus for each unmapped column and select the Apollo field. \n(Recommended) If you don't see the correct Apollo field for a column header in your CSV, you'll need to create a custom field before you can map it. \nTo create a custom field: \nCurious About Custom Fields?\nFor more information on all things custom contact fields, sneak a peek at the Create Custom Contact Fields article.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Configure the Settings and Import Your CSV\nNow that you've mapped your fields, it's time to configure the settings and import your CSV.\nTo finalize the CSV upload:\nScroll to Settings and click the What stage would you like to set the contacts to? drop-down. Then, choose the contact stage that best represents the engagement status for all of the contacts in the CSV. \nWhy does \"Contact Stage\" matter?\nIt's important to set your CSV list to the correct stage, especially if you plan to enroll the contacts in an Apollo sequence. That way, you can efficiently tailor your messaging according to their stage in your sales pipeline.\nClick the If contacts already exist in Apollo drop-down to choose whether to skip or update any contacts you've already saved in Apollo. \nWhat criteria does Apollo use to match existing contacts in Apollo to contacts in a CSV file?\nIf you choose to update existing records in Apollo with the data in your CSV, Apollo uses 3 sets of unique identifiers in order of most to least unique. Those identifiers include:\nlinkedin_URL\nfirst_name + last_name + organization \nemail address\nThis means that if you include linkedin_URL, you can update all of the other data for a person. If you include first_name + last_name + organization, but you do not include a different linkedin_URL, you can update email address and other data. If you include only email_address and you do not include the linkedin_URL or first_name + last_name + organization, then you can only update other fields for the people in your file.\nIf you opt to update existing records in Apollo from your CSV, Apollo only updates records that have a matching email address, a matching name (first and last), and a matching company.\nWhen duplicate people exist in your CSV, Apollo only accepts the highest row in the file to update the record in the platform.\nClick the If owner value is missing in your CSV, assign owner to drop-down to decide which user you want to own any imported contacts without a specified owner. \nClick the If existing contacts already have owner drop-down to choose whether or not you want to override an existing owner in Apollo with the one specified in your CSV. \nWhat happens if I update ownership?\nIf you choose to update contact ownership from the drop-down, Apollo assigns the user you selected in the If the owner value is missing in your CSV, assign owner to drop-down.\nSelect an option from the Auto-assign accounts? drop-down to determine whether or not Apollo should assign accounts based on the website or email domain for the contacts in your CSV. \nCalling All Salesforce Users!\nIf you've integrated Salesforce with Apollo, you can also decide whether or not Apollo should create and update records in Salesforce based on the uploaded CSV.\n(Optional) Click the Add to a List? drop-down to select an existing list or create a new one. When you import your CSV, Apollo adds the contacts from your file to a list in Apollo. \nClick Import to finish uploading your CSV to Apollo. \nYour upload will now begin.\nHow long will the upload take?\nMost uploads only take a few minutes to complete, but depending on the size of your CSV and the time of day, it may take a few hours for your upload to finish. Apollo does not recommend uploading a file that includes more than 10k rows. Instead, you should split your CSV into two smaller files. You can check on the status of your upload by browsing to Settings > Imports & Exports > Contact Imports.\nBack to Top\n(Optional) Apply Imported CSV Contacts to a Search\nTo search for imported contacts from your CSV file:\nLaunch Apollo and click Search.\nClick More Filters on the left. \nScroll to Contact CSV Import and click the accordion to expand the CSV filter. \nClick the checkbox next to the CSV file(s) you want to include. \nClick Apply Filters to display the people included in the selected CSV file(s). \nYou have now applied the contacts from your imported CSV file(s) to a search.

{"Topic":"Manage Your Meetings in Apollo \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nOnce you have connected your calendar and configured your default meeting settings, you can access the Apollo Meetings dashboard. From here, you can:\nCreate, edit, and activate meeting types.\nAccess your meeting schedule links.\nView your scheduled, past, and canceled meetings.\nAmend your default settings.\nBack to Top\nCreate and Edit Meeting Types\nCreate meeting types to distinguish between the meetings you host and remain in control of who can book you, when prospects can schedule meetings, and for what purpose.\nYou can edit the existing default meeting types or create new ones. There are 3 different types of meetings that you can create:\nSingle-host: This meeting type only ever has one host. Single-host meetings should be used for one-on-one discussions with your prospect.\nMulti-host: This meeting type has multiple hosts that co-host the meeting. When a prospect schedules a meeting of this type, all hosts must be available at the same time for the calendar slot to be available.\nRound robin host: This meeting type rotates between different hosts each time it is used to schedule a meeting. Round-robin meetings should also be used for one-on-one discussions. You can choose to rotate hosts based on either the availability of hosts for certain time slots or the equal distribution of hosts so that each host is booked as part of a rotation one by one.\nDifferent Plan, Different Possibilities\nIf you are on a free Apollo plan, you can activate up to 6 meeting types at a time.\nHowever, if you are on a paid plan, the world is your oyster! You can create and activate as many meeting types as you like.\nStep 1: Create a New Meeting Type\nThis process walks you through the specifics of creating a new single-host meeting type, but multi-host and round-robin host meeting types are created in a similar way. To learn about the small differences when creating those meeting types, refer to the Create Multi-Host and Round Robin Host Meeting Types section of this article.\nTo create a new single-host meeting type:\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings. Click Create, then choose the Single-host option.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Add the Meeting Type Details\nFirst, name your meeting type. This will make it easier for your prospects to identify if they are booking the right type of meeting.\nThen, click 1 of the Meeting duration options to specify how long you want this type of meeting to last.\nTo personalize the link for this meeting type, edit the text in the Meeting link text box. Click the Copy icon on the right to copy the link.\nIt Can Always Wait!\nIf you are not ready to copy the link right away, fear not! When you finish creating the new meeting type, you can access and copy the link from the Meeting Types tab at any time.\nClick the meeting location drop-down and choose which video conference platform will host your meetings: Google Meet, Zoom, or a Custom meeting link.\nAdd a description in the Meeting Description text box to give guests more context about the purpose of this meeting type.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Set Your Availability\nNow you are ready to set your availability for this meeting type.\nApollo automatically adds your default timezone to this meeting type. If you want to make any changes, click the Current timezone drop-down on the right and select the timezone of your choice.\nClick the checkboxes next to the days you want to appear available to guests for this type of meeting. Then, set your open time slots using the drop-down options on the right of each day.\nAs Easy As Pie\nApollo displays the default time slots you configured in the settings during the initial set-up. Only follow the steps to change your open time slots if you want to customize your availability for this specific meeting type.\nClick the + button on the right to create additional time slots per day. Then, use the drop-down to amend the times according to your availability. You can add as many extra time slots per day as you like.\nIf you want to replicate your availability for other days of the week, click the Copy icon. Then, click the checkbox next to the days for which you want to enable the same open time slots. When ready, click Apply.\nClick the trash can icon to delete an additional time slot.\nNext, set your meeting buffers. This option ensures that you cannot be booked for a certain amount of time you set before and\/or after a meeting.\nSet a minimum schedule notice to prevent guests from scheduling last-minute meetings with you. Set a maximum number of meetings to prevent overbooking your calendar during certain periods.\nYou can also set a maximum date range to ensure your guests don't schedule time with you too far into the future.\nBack to Top\nStep 4: Choose Your Intake Form Questions\nBy default, your intake form requires prospects to enter their name and email address. You cannot edit or remove these fields from your form.\nTo add more questions to your form:\nClick Add a question.\nChoose from standard options such as company size and phone number, or create a custom question with your own input types.\nIf you choose Single-select or Multi-select as your input type for a custom question, you need to provide answers that the prospects can select.\nBy default, Apollo sets added questions as optional. This means that the prospect does not need to answer them to schedule a meeting. Click the Set as required checkbox if you want to make a question mandatory. Then, click Save.\nTo sort your questions in a different order, drag and drop the question you want to move using the icon on the left side.\nTo edit a question, click the pencil icon on the right side of it. To delete the question from your form, click the trash can icon.\nBack to Top\nStep 5: Add an Email Reminder\nTo ensure that a prospect remembers to attend a meeting they booked with you, set up an automatic email reminder for them. You can skip this step if you prefer not to send a reminder.\nTo set up an email reminder:\nToggle the Inactive option to Active.\nYou can keep or edit the default email subject and text Apollo provides. To edit the text field, use the options along the edit bar at the bottom of the field. You can insert links, images, dyanmic variables, and snippets.\nTo preview your email, click the eyeball icon at the top left. If you want to preview the email in an inbox, click Send test email to me. Apollo then sends the preview to the default email inbox connected to your Apollo account.\nIn the timing section, choose when you want to send your email reminder. If you want to send multiple reminders, click Add timing. You can add up to 3 reminders.\nWhen you have added all details for this single-host meeting type, click Create meeting.\nYou have now created a new single-host meeting type.\nBack to Top\nCreate Single-host Meeting Types for Other Users (Admins Only)\nIf you are an Apollo admin for your organization, you can create single-host meetings that other users host. This option enables you to apply standard templates to different types of meetings, such as demo meetings, and add or remove hosts as needed.\nThe steps you as an admin follow to create these meeting types are similar to single-host meetings. The most significant difference is that you need to choose the hosts for the meeting type.\nHost Your Own Meetings\nIf you are an Apollo admin and want to create a single-host meeting type that only you can use, only add yourself as a host when creating the meeting type.\nWhen choosing hosts, click All hosts to make the meeting type available to everyone, or click Select individual hosts or teams to add specific members of your organization as hosts.\nYou also need to use an intake form template rather than adding intake form questions for a single meeting type.\nAs you create single-host meetings for your organization, you should educate potential meeting hosts on how to find and use these meeting types. To find these single-host meetings, users should launch Apollo and click Meetings. The admin-created meetings show a special icon in place of the activation slider.\nAs an admin, you can also add a link for the single-host meeting type to a sequence in Apollo that can be used by the hosts of the meeting. The link includes a variable that populates information specific to each meeting host.\nTo copy this link, launch Apollo and click Meetings. Then, click additional options > Copy Link for the single-host meeting type that you created.\nWhen you paste the link into an email within a sequence, the preview shows how the variable will populate for the hosts you assigned to the meeting type.\nTo manage the single-host meetings you create, launch Apollo and click Meetings > Admin console. Then, access the Team's Meeting tab.\nBack to Top\nCreate Multi-Host and Round Robin Host Meeting Types\nThe steps you follow to create these meeting types are similar to single-host meetings. There are currently a few slight differences:\nThe number of meeting types that you can create is also restricted if you are on a free Apollo plan:\nFor free plans, individual users can create up to 6 single-host and multi-host meeting types. Also, teams can create up to 6 round-robin meeting types.\nFor paid plans, you can create an unlimited number of meeting types.\nAll other steps are the same. Follow the instructions in the sections above to create multi-host or round robin meeting types.\nInbound Routers Bring More than Meeting Routing\nApollo admins can add an intake form to the scheduling process for all meeting types by creating an inbound router! This enables admins to add more questions to intake forms, and route prospects to different meeting types based on their answers.\nBack to Top\nEdit an Existing Meeting Type\nTo edit a meeting type:\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings. Click the Additional Options (...) button on the top right of the meeting type you want to edit, then click Edit.\nMake edits to the meeting type details and then click Save changes.\nYou have now edited an existing meeting type.\nBack to Top\nAccess Your Meeting Schedule Links\nNow that you have created or edited your meeting types, you can copy the meeting schedule links and then share them with your future guests.\nTo access the link:\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings. Click the Meeting Types tab. Then, click Copy link under the meeting type you want to share with a prospect.\nYou have now copied the unique meeting schedule link for a specific meeting type.\nPreview the Guest Scheduling Workflow\nTo gauge your guests' scheduling experience and ensure you have configured the details of each meeting type correctly, you can access a preview of the guest scheduling workflow.\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings. Then, click Preview on the bottom-right of the meeting type you want to edit.\nApollo directs you to the same scheduling process as the one prospects will follow for that meeting type.

{"Topic":"Integrate Your Web Forms with Meetings \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nApollo enables you to build an integration between the web forms on your own website and the scheduling functionality of its inbound router. Your web forms can serve as a substitute for the intake forms you create when setting up inbound routers.\nContinue to collect data from prospects on your website, and then provide them with the ability to easily schedule meetings with your team based on the inbound routers you create in Apollo. This can be accomplished in a single, seamless workflow.\nBack to Top\nStep 0: Before You Begin\nThe instructions provided in the Step 1 and Step 2 sections of this article can be completed by an Apollo admin. Technical skills are not required.\nThe Step 3 instructions require knowledge of HTML and a front-end language like JavaScript, along with access to your website's codebase. If you or your team do not possess those technical skills or access, work with your organization to arrange the necessary help.\nBack to Top\nStep 1: Create an Inbound Router (or Use an Existing Router)\nYou will map your web form fields to the fields in an Apollo inbound router. Create (or update) an inbound router that includes all of the fields that you want to map to your web form.\nIf you have already created an inbound router with the fields you want to map, proceed to Step 2.\nIf you do not have an inbound router with the desired fields, please refer to Create Inbound Routers for Your Meetings to learn how to create or update inbound routers. Then, return to this article and continue with Step 2.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Copy Apollo JS Snippet and Map Fields\nWith an inbound router created, you can proceed to mapping the fields between your web form and Apollo, and then generating the JavaScript snippet to add to your website.\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings.\nClick Inbound routers. Find the inbound router you want to use with your web form, and then click additional options (...) Share. \nClick the Integrate with your website form tab. Enter the domain(s) where your web form is located, and then press enter on your keyboard to save your domain entries. Apollo does not support trailing slashes, so do not include \/ at the end of your domains.\nYou can add up to 5 domains, including subdomains. For example, Apollo integrating web forms on https:\/\/app.apollo.io and https:\/\/knowledge.apollo.io would occupy 2 of the 5 available domains. \nClick the Form field autofill toggle if you want Apollo to automatically populate any fields with Apollo data when a user inputs their email address into your form. \nThen, click the Hide autofilled form fields toggle if you want to streamline the form filling experience for your prospects. Form shortening hides any fields that Apollo autofills from the end user's view. This means that your prospects will only see and need to fill out the fields for which Apollo does not have data. You need to activate the form field autofill toggle to enable this feature. \nBe Mindful\nPlease note, Apollo recommends that you use the form field autofill feature with caution. If you don't want to alarm a prospect when a field automatically populates with their data, consider enabling the form field autofill and form shortening features together.\nPlease also note that for form autofill and shortening to work, your webform must be structered correctly as per HTML semantics. Make sure you have wrapped all inputs within the form element and assigned relevent label tags. You must also ensure that you map your inbound router fields to your web form fields correctly, as per the following step.\nNext, map your inbound router fields to your web form fields. The inbound router fields are already populated, so you only need to enter the corresponding web form field. If an inbound router field allows a prospect to select from multiple options, you should ensure that your web form provides the same options.\nThe web form field names entered here must match the field names in your code. If there is an emailaddress field in the code of your web form, enter that full name, not email.\nOnce you have mapped all your fields, select Continue. \nApollo generates the JavaScript snippet to add to your website. Click Copy Code to add it to your clipboard, and then click Done to exit.\nIf you are building the rest of the integration on your website, keep the code snippet yourself. Otherwise, send it to the personnel that will complete the integration setup. \nWith your code snippet generated, continue to Step 3.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Build Your Web Form Integration\nTo integrate your web form with Apollo meetings, you must have the JavaScript snippet generated by Apollo in Step 2. If you don't have the snippet, please follow the instructions in Step 2 before attempting to update your website.\nThe following sub-sections provide the building blocks that you can use to build your integration, from establishing the basic flow of passing the web form entries to defining more advanced options.\nBack to Top\nAdd the JS Snippet to Your Website\nAdd the JavaScript snippet generated in Step 2 to your website's code.\nIn the following example, Apollo added the snippet between the head tags of a website's HTML.\nThe snippet creates a window.ApolloMeetings object that can be accessed from anywhere in the app\/console. You should use this object to both pass web form entries to Apollo and, if you choose, to utilize custom options.\nBack to Top\nCustomize initWidget\nThe initWidget initiates the scheduling flow from Apollo. Access it via the window.ApolloMeetings object.\ninitWidget: ({ appId: string, schedulingLink: string, domElement?: HTMLElement }) = void; \nThis widget includes 3 elements:\nappId: This is a unique ID that is generated along with the JavaScript snippet in Apollo.\nschedulingLink: An identifier for your inbound router.\ndomElement: By default, Apollo adds the widget at the end of your website's body tag. If you prefer to open the widget on a different element, you can define that choice here.\nBack to Top\nPass Web Form Submissions Data to Apollo\nWith Apollo's JS snippet added to your website, you need to capture the data from your web form's submissions and pass the entries to Apollo.\nThe easiest way to pass the entries is to use window.ApolloMeetings.submit() without defining any options. By default, this option captures entries from the first form element on a webpage and passes them to Apollo via an API call. Only input elements with name attributes are captured.\nconst handleFormSubmit = () = { window.ApolloMeetings.submit() } \nBack to Top\nAdd Third-party Form Integrations\nIn addition to your own web forms, you can also capture data from HubSpot and Marketo web form submissions on your website and pass those entries to Apollo. You still need to add Apollo's JS snippet to your website.\nHubSpot\nFor HubSpot forms, add the following snippet to your website. When a user submits the HubSpot form, the data is passed to Apollo and the scheduling flow is triggered. Hubspot forms dispatch an event called hsFormCallback on the window object, which has the values of the Hubspot form integrated on the respective website. A listener to this event is attached to the window object.\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) { if (event.data.type === \"hsFormCallback\" && event.data.eventName === \"onFormSubmitted\") { const lead = event.data.data.submissionValues; window.ApolloMeetings.submit({ map: false, lead }); } }); \nMarketo\nFor Marketo forms, add the following snippet to your website. When a user submits the Marketo form, the data is passed to Apollo and the scheduling flow is triggered. This snippet attaches Apollo's submit function to the MktoForms2.loadForm method.\nMktoForms2.loadForm(BASE_URL, MUNCHKIN_ID, FORM_ID, function(form) { form.onSuccess(function(values) { window.ApolloMeetings.submit({ map: false, lead: values }); return false; }); }); \nBack to Top\nDefine Options\nIn addition to using window.ApolloMeetings.submit() to pass web form entires to Apollo, you can set several options to improve the experience for you and your prospects.\nformId (String)\nBy default, Apollo captures entries from the first web form to appear on a webpage. Any element of a webpage that captures user input could be a form though.\nUse formId to capture entries from a specific form. Use the id attribute from the form and add it in window.ApolloMeetings.submit().\nconst handleFormSubmit = (e) = { e.preventDefault(); \/\/ myForm is the id attribute for the form. window.ApolloMeetings.submit({formId : \"myForm\"}); }; \nmap (Boolean) and lead (Object)\nBy default, map is set to false, which means Apollo handles extracting the data from your web form. Apollo relies on input tags in your form's HTML to retrieve this information.\nIf you prefer to use the Salesforce lead object format, set map to true. Then, define lead per the following code example so that the correct data is passed to Apollo.\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({ map: true, lead : {name: state.name, email: state.email} }); \ncloseOnOutside (Boolean)\nThe scheduling flow is delivered via an Apollo pop-up window. By default, a prospect clicking the gray background area outside the pop-up closes the window.\nTo change this behavior, set closeOnOutside to true.\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({ closeOnOutside : true }); \npreventRedirect (Boolean) and onRedirect (String)\nWhen creating an inbound router in Apollo, you can choose to send prospects to an external URL. This option prevents non-ideal prospects from booking meetings.\nIf the inbound router uses this option, you can choose to take control of all the URL redirects and send prospects to a different URL. This could enable you to perform better metric tracking or to pass prospects through URL shorteners.\nIf you want to change the redirect, set preventRedirect to false. Then, set onRedirect to the desired URL.\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({ preventRedirect: false, \/\/ Enter the URL you want to use for the redirect. onRedirect :(url) = {https:\/\/www.replacethisurl.com} }); \nonSuccess (Function), onError (Function), and onRouted (Function)\nUse these 3 callback functions to determine what happens after a prospect has submitted a web form.\nSet onSuccess to define what happens after a prospect has successfully scheduled a meeting.\nIf the inbound router fails at any point, Apollo delivers the specific error in response. Set onError to guide the prospect after the error.\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({ \/\/ Define your error function. onError : (error) = {}, \/\/ Define your success function. onSuccess: () = {} }) \nSet onRouted to call a function when the inbound router has been triggered. This occurs after the web form is submitted, but before the prospect has either successfully or unsuccessfuly scheduled a meeting.\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({ onRouted : (result) = { if(result.success) { \/\/ routing success \/\/ get what type of routing happeneded from const type = result.type } else { \/\/ routing failure, see error in result.error const error = result.error } } }) \nonRouter provides details about both whether an action was successfully reached in the inbound router and, if so, which action was reached.\nonRouted?: ( params: | { success: false; error: string } | { success: true; type: 'custom_message' | 'book_meeting' | 'redirect_to_url' }, ) = void; \nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Build and Access Dashboards In Apollo \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nStandard Features for Everybody!\nAll users across all plans can access analytics features such as email tracking and Apollo-provided reports and dashboards for email messaging, deal metrics, and more. If you require customizable reports and dashboards, work with your Apollo representative or contact the Apollo Sales Team to move to a Custom plan.\nApollo Analytics provide you with actionable data you can use to transform your company's sales efforts. One facet of the Analytics suite is the Dashboards feature. Dashboards provide you with a means of visualizing several related reports in a common interface.\nRefer to the sections below to learn how to create custom Dashboards, access existing Dashboards, and better understand the various features you have at your disposal.\nBack to Top\nAccess Dashboards in Apollo\nTo access Dashboards, launch Apollo and click Engage.\nClick Analytics.\nClick Dashboards.\nAny previously created Dashboards are available on the left-hand side of the screen.\nIf you would like to create a new Dashboard, click + New Dashboard.\nBack to Top\nCreate a New Custom Dashboard\nFrom the Dashboards section of the Analytics page, click + New Dashboard.\nThere are 3 main configuration components of any Dashboard: Reports, Filters, and Data Range. The sections below outline how to set up each of these Dashboard components.\nBack to Top\nAdd Reports\nFrom the new Dashboard, there are several ways to add Reports.\nReports aggregate in-app metrics into various visualization types while using specific filters to refine the visualizations. Dashboards aggregate those Reports into a single location. You can include as many Reports in a Dashboard as you would like.\nAdd Existing Reports\nYou can use the search bar on the right-hand side of your screen to find a Report to add to your Dashboard.\nOnce you find the Report, click it to add it to the Dashboard.\nSearch is Optional\nPlease note, if you know which Reports that you want to add to the Dashboard you can click them directly and ignore the search feature.\nYou can rearrange the report tiles as needed.\nCreate and Add New Reports\nAlthough the process is less streamlined, you can create new Custom Reports directly from a new Dashboard. To add a new Report to the Dashboard, make sure you give the Dashboard a name and save it.\nDashboard Naming\nAs a best practice, consider a Dashboard name that reflects its intended Data Range (for example, \"Monthly\"), its intended use (for example, \"SDR Performance\"), and if necessary, the intended audience for which it's meant (for example, \"SDR Manager\").\nOnce it's saved, click Edit Dashboard.\nClick + New Report.\nFollow the instructions in the Build and Access Reports in Apollo article to create your New Report.\nAfter you create and save the new Report, click the Dashboard tab on the left-hand side of your screen.\nThen, click the name of the Dashboard that you want to add the new Report to.\nClick Edit Dashboard.\nClick the new Report that you just created on the right-hand side of your screen to add it to the Dashboard.\nBack to Top\nConfigure Filters\nWithin a Dashboard, you can apply additional filters to all of the included Reports.\nAfter you save your Dashboard, click Filters.\nClick + Add Filter.\nFilters allow you to include or exclude specific subsets of data in every Report on your Dashboard. You can add as many Filters as you need to each Dashboard.\nDashboard-Level Filters\nPlease note, the Filters that you apply on a Dashboard do not override the Filters from individual Reports. They act as add-ons to the already existing filters in each Report.\nApollo groups filters into the following categories:\nCategory Description \nUser\tFilter related to the specific individual(s) taking the action in the Apollo platform\t\nDate\tFilters related to the time period of the action taken in the Apollo platform (for example, day, hour, month, year, etc.)\t\nContact\/Person\tFilters related to the information about the individuals contacted from the Apollo platform (for example, their persona type, their location, their stage in the sales pipeline, etc.)\t\nAccount\/Company\tFilters related to the information about the companies contacted from the Apollo platform (for example, the account name, the number of company employees, the industry, related keywords, etc.)\t\nEmail\tFilters related to the type of emails sent from the Apollo platform (for example, email subject, template used, etc.)\t\nPhone Call\tFilters related to the purpose and disposition of the phone calls made from the Apollo platform\t\nSequence\tFilters related to the name of the sequence or the specific step that was used to engage with the prospects in the Apollo platform\t\nClick Select Filter to choose the relevant dimensions that you want to include in your Dashboard.\nClick the Select drop-down to include or exclude additional metrics.\nClick Run to update the Dashboard with the new Filters.\nTo delete a Filter, click the trash can icon on the right-hand side of the screen.\nThen, click Run to implement the changes.\nOverlapping Filters\nPlease note, if you apply a Dashboard Filter that's in direct conflict with a Filter from any of the Reports in your new Dashboard, Apollo discards and replaces the Report Filter with the Dashboard Filter whenever you view the Dashboard; however, when you view the individual Report, the original Filter will remain in effect.\nTo make the best use of Dashboard Filters, first, build each report with the Filters you have in mind. When you add Reports to the Dashboard and want to view the same metrics for a different set of users, emails, contacts, etc., you can then apply a Dashboard Filter to further refine the visible data.\nFor example, you can create a report for a specific SDR or ADR. You can add it to an SDR\/ADR team Dashboard and add a filter on the Dashboard to view metrics for all of your SDR\/ADRs instead of just the one.\nDashboard Filters\nPlease note, you do not have to set Filters for a new Dashboard. If you choose not to set Dashboard Filters, the original Filters on each Report remain in effect.\nBack to Top\nConfigure Data Range\nFrom the new Dashboard, click the timeframe on the right-hand side (in this instance, the label displays No Data Range Specified).\nClick Select Data Range.\nThink about the Data Range like the gap of time for all of the data in the Dashboard. Apollo provides several defined timeframes for the data that you want to visualize in your Dashboard.\nYou can also define your own timeframe using the Custom Range option.\nIf you apply a Dashboard Data Range, it overrides the Data Range set in every individual Report included in the Dashboard. This change only applies to the Dashboards page. If you view any of the individual Reports in your Dashboard from the Reports page, the original Data Range remains in effect.\nAfter you apply a Dashboard Data Range, you can change it to another Data Range any time you like; however, you cannot delete it altogether.\nIf you choose a Dynamic Data Range (for example, Current Week, Last 90 Days, or This Quarter), remember to click Run on a regular basis. This will ensure that the data you view is always up-to-date.\nDashboard Data Ranges\nPlease note, you do not have to set a Data Range for a new Dashboard. If you choose not to set a Dashboard Data Range, the original timeframe set on each Report remains in effect.\nBack to Top\nLaunch Existing Dashboards\nAs the name implies, Existing Dashboards are the Dashboards already present in the Apollo platform. They include any Dashboards you or your team have created.\nPublic Dashboards and Private Dashboards are both available from the Analytics page. From that page, click the \"Dashboards\" tab, scroll down the \"Dashboards\" column, and click the Dashboard you want to open.\nAnother way to find an Existing Dashboard is to use the Search Bar.\nThere are several features available when you work with Existing Dashboards.\nBack to Top\nEdit Existing Dashboards\nFrom the Analytics page, click the Dashboards tab.\nYou can use the Search bar to find a Dashboard or browse through folders on the left-hand side and click the Dashboard that you want to edit.\nSelect the Dashboard and then click Edit Dashboard on the right-hand side.\nYou can also click the additional options (...) button next to any Dashboards and then click Edit.\nFrom the Dashboard, you have several editing options:\nAdd or Remove Report Tiles\nEdit Reports\nRe-size, Drag, and Drop Report Tiles\nMove and Rename Existing Dashboards\nReorganize Dashboards\nAdd or Remove Reports From a Dashboard\nTo add new and existing Reports to a Dashboard, follow the instructions in the Add Reports section above.\nTo remove a Report from a Dashboard, click the additional options (...) button on the right-hand side of a Report on the Dashboard.

If you cannot access all the latest and greatest scoring updates yet, we haven't forgotten you! Please bear with us while we fine-tune the magic formula.\nOverview\nWhen you integrate CRMs like Salesforce and HubSpot with Apollo, there are several steps you can take to reduce the risk of duplicating records.\nHowever, if duplicate data is already present, you can reduce those duplicate records using Apollo's data deduplication tool. The tool enables you to set the criteria for what is considered a duplicate record and review the potential duplicates before Apollo merges them. This improves data integrity and ensures that your team can trust the data in Apollo.\nAdmin Only\nOnly users with admin permissions in Apollo can use the data deduplication tool. If you do not have access, please contact the Apollo admins in your organization.\nStep 1: Set Criteria for Identifying Duplicate Records\nApollo identifies duplicate records based on your criteria. By adjusting the criteria, you increase the likelihood of identifying the duplicates you want to merge.\nTo set the criteria for data deduplication:\nLaunch Apollo and click Data enrichment.\nClick Configure duplicate detection rules. \nIn the Matching rules tab, click the checkbox for each rule that you want Apollo to use to identify duplicate records. For example, select Email address if you want contact records with the same email address to be considered potential duplicates. \nAdd multiple rules to increase match confidence. If you use multiple rules, click Mark as main to use a rule as the primary criterion for determining the contact record to keep after merging records. \nThen, click Next. \nIn the Primary record selection tab, drag and drop the prioritization rules to place them in order of importance. Apollo uses these rules to determine which record among duplicates is the primary record, which is the record that remains after the merge. Click Show rule details to review an explanation of each rule. \nWith the rules in order, click Configure. \nWith your rules set, you are ready to merge duplicate records.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Merge Duplicate Records\nWith your criteria for identifying duplicate records set, you are ready to merge duplicate records in Apollo.\nTo merge a set of duplicate records:\nClick View duplicates. \nFind a set of contact records that you want to merge, then click View duplicates. \nReview the full details for each duplicate contact record. Apollo determines the primary record based on the rules you established in the Step 1 section. If you want to change the primary record, click the trophy for the record you want to make the primary. \nDifferences between the duplicate records are highlighted in red. For example, if most duplicate records use the same job title, the records with a different title might be highlighted red. \nTo merge all of the records in a group, click Merge all. \nTo merge specific records, click the checkbox for each record you want to merge, then click Merge selected. \nClick Reject selected or Reject all to reject records from being merged. \nClick Confirm merge.\nThe duplicate contact records are now merged in Apollo. Repeat this process to merge more sets of duplicate records.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Build an Outbound Sales Process: Metrics \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Setting the Scene\nOutbound sales is a numbers game. Before you get started with your outreach, you need to set concrete goals, decide upon the metrics that you wish to use to measure your success, and set a benchmark of comparison from which you can build.\nStart by thinking about:\nHow many accounts and contacts do you wish to engage with\nHow many emails you will send out per day\nHow many touches\u2014or, number of times you engage a prospect\u2014you will include in each sequence\nIf you have run previous campaigns, you can use your historical data as a benchmark of comparison. If this is your first outbound campaign, you can use the sample metrics in this module as a reference so that when you start to gather the results from your new campaigns, you will have quantitative data to measure against your results. There are a number of data points you can focus on. We\u2019d recommend concentrating on the following to begin with:\n% of email open rates\n% of replies\n% of interested contacts\nThe number of meetings set\nThe number of closed\/won deals\nStart by drafting out the data points that you want to gather in your own Outbound Sales Metrics table:\nType of Metric Data Points to Measure Benchmark Metrics \nTargeting\t\n# Accounts\n# Contacts\/Accounts\n# Emails\/Contacts\n\t\t\nActivity\t\n# Emails\n\t\t\nQuality of Activity\t\n% Email Open\n% Email Reply\n% Email Interested Rate\n\t\t\nResults\t\n# Meetings from Email\n\t\t\nSales Cycle\t\nMeeting \u2014 Win Rate\nClosed\/Won Deals\n\t\t\nEach metric you measure will provide you with key insights into the growth and health of your sales strategies. Gathering the data and analyzing the performance of your sales efforts allows you to constantly review, experiment, and improve to reach your sales targets.\nBack to Top\nApollo Example\nIn the table below, we have included sample metrics that you can use as a benchmark when first starting out.\nType of Metric Data Points to Measure Benchmark Results My Metrics: Month 1 Analysis \nTargeting\t\n# Accounts\n# Contacts\/Accounts\n# Emails\/Contacts\n\t\n100-1000\n2-5\n2-5\n\t\t\t\nActivity\t\n# Emails\n\t\n200-500 per day\n\t\t\t\nQuality of Activity\t\n% Email Open\n% Email Reply\n% Email Interested Rate\n\t\n30%-50%\n1%-10%\n0.2%-2%\n\t\t\t\nResults\t\n# Meetings from Email\n\t\n10-20 per month\n\t\t\t\nSales Cycle\t\nMeeting \u2014 Win Rate\nClosed\/Won Deals\n\t\n20%-30%\n2-5 per month\n\t\t\t\nStart Here, but Don't Stay Here!\nThe more data you gather and metrics you measure, the less relevant these benchmark statistics will become. Over time, you will need to use your historical data as the biggest judge of your progress; adapting your target metrics to fit your specific business, industry, and market.\nBack to Top\nDissecting the Numbers\nOnce you decide upon the number of companies that you want to target\u2014between 100 and 1,000 is a good starting point\u2014you need to decide how many contacts you will target within each account and how many times you will engage with each person. We recommend that you start by contacting at least 2-5 contacts from within the same company and sending at least 2-5 emails to each.\nPro Tip!\nMake sure you don\u2019t engage with all of the contacts at the same company at the same time. Instead, try to space out your communications with prospects from the same company across multiple days.\nNow that you know how many accounts you want to target, think about how many emails you should send in a day. A good benchmark for Apollo users is anywhere between 200-500 emails per rep, per day. This provides you with a large enough sample size to analyze the quality of the activity and calculate the conversion rates between opened emails, replies, meetings set, and closed deals.\nYou should also pay close attention to the % email interest rate. This is a key statistic that provides insight into the number of contacts that have confirmed they would like to attend a meeting from the total number of emails you sent out in a month. Using this information, you can then determine the conversion rates per sales rep. Generally speaking, each sales rep should be aiming to secure at least 10-20 meetings per month, but depending on your industry, coaching methods, and approach, one rep could set up as many as 50-100 meetings per month.\nThe more meetings you set, the better chance you have of closing deals. As a benchmark, try to achieve at least a 20%-30% win rate by closing 2-5 deals per month per rep. But always keep in mind that these target metrics are according to the industry average. They give you an idea of the baseline statistics for outbound sales. However, after the first few months of outreach, you should be able to gain a better understanding of what\u2019s possible for your company in your specific market. You can then adapt your sales targets accordingly.\nBack to Top\nPractical Exercise\nCopy the benchmark results into the metrics table you created earlier and add two new columns for your own metrics and reflections. Please note, you won\u2019t need to fill these columns in until you complete this course and begin executing your outbound sales strategy in Apollo, so keep the table handy and get ready to jump back into it when you have your first month of data to record and compare.\nType of Metric Data Points to Measure Benchmark Results My Metrics: Month 1 Analysis \nTargeting\t\n# Accounts\n# Contacts\/Accounts\n# Emails\/Contacts\n\t\n100-1000\n2-5\n2-5\n\t\t\t\nActivity\t\n# Emails\n\t\n200-500 per day\n\t\t\t\nQuality of Activity\t\n% Email Open\n% Email Reply\n% Email Interested Rate\n\t\n30%-50%\n1%-10%\n0.2%-2%\n\t\t\t\nResults\t\n# Meetings from Email\n\t\n10-20 per month\n\t\t\t\nSales Cycle\t\nMeeting \u2014 Win Rate\nClosed\/Won Deals\n\t\n<li20%-30%> \n2-5 per month\n<\/li20%-30%>\n\t\t\t\nBack to Top\nNext Steps\nNow that you have some sample metrics and key data points at the ready so that you can compare and calculate your team\u2019s conversion rates, continue to the next article in this course to learn about how to \"Create a Product Market Fit Canvas.\" In this next module, we will discuss the key role that your PMF hypothesis will play as you start to develop an effective outbound sales process for your company.\nBack to Top"}

Here, you will learn the basic principles that define an effective sales strategy and will come away with concrete examples to help you reach, engage, and convert the right prospects, at the right time.\nBack to Top\nThe Apollo Story\nApollo started out in 2015 with a big vision and a lot to learn\u2014outbound sales have since become instrumental to our revenue and business growth. In early 2016, we went from $20,000 in revenue to $300,000 in 4 months. By the end of 2016, we went from $300,000 in revenue to $1 million in 3 months. Just a few years down the road and Apollo is now a world leader in the data intelligence and sales engagement space. The Apollo platform helps over 10,000 paying customers and over half a million Apollo users to build and scale their outbound sales systems. These results were achieved almost exclusively thanks to the outbound sales process that we have followed. In this course, we will be dissecting the ingredients of our success so that you can take actionable steps to achieve similar results for your company.\nBack to Top\nOutbound Sales 101 Overview\nWhat is an Outbound Sales Process and why do you need to develop one for your business? It all boils down to one simple concept:\nTo operate a business, you need revenue. To generate revenue, you need to secure meetings and convert those conversations into sales.\nNot all companies use outbound sales tactics. Some depend primarily on inbound sales and referrals. Although these methodologies have their benefits, they can only take your business so far. Companies that create an effective outbound sales process are able to generate opportunities quickly and repeatedly at scale.\nOutbound sales is a tried and tested tactic for companies in all stages of growth. You may choose to tap into outbound strategies before your product is even live or to generate your first 10 customers. On the other hand, you may use outbound to scale your business from 10 to 200 customers or from 200 to 10,000. The sales strategy you execute should depend on the specific stage in which your business is at. In this Build an Outbound Sales Process course, we will concentrate on the outbound tactics to follow if you want to take your business from 1 to 10 customers or from 10 to 200 customers.\nBack to Top\nCourse Outline\nWe\u2019ve broken this course into 6 bite-sized chunks:\nOutbound Sales Metrics\nSales metrics help you to gauge the success of your sales efforts over time. You can use a number of data points to evaluate and compare your results against your business goals. This module will look at some sample sales metrics that you can use as a benchmark when first carrying out your outbound sales strategy. By the end of this course, you should be ready to adapt these metrics to your business goals and target market so that you can continue to scale your sales initiatives and in turn, dramatically boost revenue.\nBack to Top\nCreate a Product Market Fit Canvas\nA Product Market Fit Canvas is a holistic summary of the different facets of your product and value propositions matched against the main goals, challenges, and needs of your market. In this module, we\u2019ll deep dive into the PMF fundamentals, look at examples, and equip you with the knowledge you need to create your own Product Market Fit Canvas for every outbound campaign that you run.\nBack to Top\nTarget Real Buyers\nSales targeting is the process in which you identify, find, target, and engage with the right contacts, from the right companies, through the right channels, at the right time. In this module, you\u2019ll learn more about why targeting is important, you\u2019ll see examples of how to use Apollo to find your ideal customers, and you\u2019ll put this knowledge into practice with a practical exercise.\nBack to Top\nCraft Killer Sales Email Messaging\nWriting effective outbound sales messaging means learning how to speak the language of your potential customers and transmitting your message to the right people in a concise, engaging, and relatable way. There are many methods to crafting optimal sales messaging to engage and convert your ideal prospects. In this module, we will focus primarily on leveraging the Research, Reference, Reward, and Request approach, we will share some useful resources, provide examples of first touch and follow-up messages, and set you up for writing your own killer messaging within Apollo.\nBack to Top\nOutbound Sales Analytics\nSales analytics play a fundamental role in understanding and improving your outbound sales strategy. By analyzing the data from your campaigns, you can A\/B test different tactics, evaluate what is and isn\u2019t working, and make strategic improvements to increase your open, click, response, and win rates. In this module, you\u2019ll learn about what to experiment with and why. You\u2019ll also find out more about how to leverage the Apollo Analytics tool to gain valuable insights into the performance of your sales campaigns.\nBack to Top\nAdditional Considerations\nIn sales, there is no single right answer for all prospects. The tactics that work on one of your buyer personas may not work on another. The channels, messaging, number of touches, and overall approach you take are likely to differ drastically depending on many factors such as industry, Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), and product offerings. In this course, you will learn how to choose the type of approach that best fits your business. On top of that, we\u2019ll look at how to keep your domain healthy and the best methods to avoid SPAM so you can ensure your emails arrive safe and sound in the right inboxes at the right time.\nBack to Top\nPractical Exercise\nWithout checking the information above, write down the 6 facets that make up an effective outbound sales process. Next to each one, write down your understanding of each and why you think they are important aspects of a successful sales strategy.

Leverage LinkedIn to access key information about your target Contacts, such as:\nWork history and experience\nCurrent employer\nHobbies and Interests\nCurrent colleagues\nApollo allows you to leverage LinkedIn in your Sequences to store a contact's personalized information and set reminders for yourself.\nSequences in Apollo allow you to refine your messaging. You can use Sequences to A\/B test messages and ensure that you successfully engage with your customers. You can then hyper-focus your messaging and personalize your approach with information from LinkedIn.\nThis use case explores the steps you can take to leverage LinkedIn with Sequences.\nBack to Top\nSample Workflow\nFind the Right Contacts\nThe first thing you need to do before you can launch an effective campaign is to find the right contacts that match your vision. Randomly contacting people is inefficient and won't yield positive results. You need to find a targeted audience.\nProspect with LinkedIn\nIt's easy to leverage data from LinkedIn to prospect with the tools Apollo provides. The first thing you should do is search for and request details about prospects from LinkedIn Sales Navigator, LinkedIn, or directly from the Apollo database. Read the \"Prospect in LinkedIn\" article for in-depth instructions. \nUse the Apollo Chrome Extension\nThe Apollo Chrome Extension works in conjunction with LinkedIn to help you get the data you need to reach your goals. You can prospect contact and account data directly from LinkedIn and complete many tasks through Apollo directly from LinkedIn, such as: request an email address, make a call, and add a saved contact to a list or Sequence. Read the \"Apollo Chrome Extension Overview\" for more information.\nCreate Personas\nPersonas are sets of titles, seniorities, and departments that define different groups of people that you can target within key accounts. This allows you to find contacts faster with Apollo's search tool, receive better recommendations, and improve analytics. You can use Personas to narrow your LinkedIn searches. For more on Personas, read the \"Create a Persona\" article. \nBack to Top\nPlan Your Strategy\nNow that you have a solid list of prospects, you can start to plan your strategy. Apollo offers automation tools like Sequences and templates to help you organize and standardize your messaging.\nCreate a Sequence\nYou can leverage the LinkedIn steps capability in the Apollo Sequences feature to organize your messaging and categorize your contacts. For each contact in your Sequence, you can add steps to track interacting in LinkedIn from initial contact to sending a direct message. Apollo reminds you when you should complete different steps in the Sequence to keep you on task. For more information, read the \"Complete a LinkedIn Task in a Sequence\" article. \nOh, The Things You Can Do!\nYou can use Apollo Sequences for much more than tracking LinkedIn tasks. Check out the \"Sequences Overview\" and \"Create a Sequence\" articles for more information on how sequences are used in Apollo.\nDraft LinkedIn Messaging\nYou can draft personalized messages through Apollo. Some general best practices for LinkedIn messaging are:\nPersonalize your messages\nBe direct and keep it short\nClearly communicate your goal\nSuggest ways to meet or speak further\nHave a clear and concise signature\nTime your messages during normal business hours\nYou should use the dynamic variables and snippets features in the message template to personalize your messaging at scale. For more information on how snippets work, read the \"Create and Edit Snippets\" article. For more information about dynamic variables, hop into the \"Use Basic Dynamic Variables\" article. \nBack to Top\nExecute Your Strategy\nNow that you found your ideal prospects and planned your messaging strategy, it's time to put your plan into motion. Part of executing your strategy is finding the perfect way to communicate your message and sometimes that requires trial and error to hone your skills. Here are some steps you can take to execute and perfect your strategy.\nAdd Contacts to Your Sequence\nNow that you created your LinkedIn Sequence, you need to add contacts to it. When you add contacts to the LinkedIn Sequence, Apollo will track each contact through the steps you added to the Sequence. For more on how to add contacts to a Sequence, read the \"Add Contacts to a Sequence\" article. \nImplement Your Sequence\nYou already created your tasks and now you can begin tracking your correspondence with your contacts. Apollo shows you which step a contact is in while they are in a Sequence when you visit their contact card. In this manner, you can track where exactly a contact is in the LinkedIn Sequence. \nRefine Your Message\nWhile you can't A\/B test with LinkedIn messaging, you can refine your message to optimize your results. You should always be on the lookout for clearer wording and more personalized messaging to help grab the attention of your potential contacts. Over time, you should develop a comfort level with LinkedIn messaging and your results should improve.\nNo Overnight Successes\nPlease note, developing the right messaging strategy takes time and effort.

Only then, great results you will see.\nTo start sending personalized, automated messaging to your ideal prospects directly from an Apollo sequence, you first need to complete a few important preparatory steps.\nIntegrate Your CRM With Apollo\nIf your company uses a CRM, you should begin by integrating it with the Apollo platform. This means that when you begin your outreach efforts, you can ensure that your data is always up-to-date and in sync. It also means that you can visualize and stay in control of which team members contact which prospects.\nCRM Integration\nPlease note, Salesforce offers the largest degree of enrichment functionality in Apollo, but Apollo also supports CRM integrations with HubSpot.\nUse the links below for the CRM that you want to integrate and configure with Apollo.\nWhat if my company doesn't use a CRM?\nIf your company does not use a CRM to maintain information about your customers, you should upload a CSV of \"Do Not Contact\" customers to avoid reaching out to them.

You can link any type of mailbox to Apollo. For a full list of the Email Service Providers (ESPs) that Apollo supports, refer to the \"Supported Email Service Providers (ESPs)\" article; however, Gmail provides the most compatibility and functionality in Apollo.\nFollow the step by step instructions in the \"Link Your Mailbox to Apollo.io\" article to get set up.\nBack To Top\nSet Up Your Email Signature\nNow that you have linked your mailbox, it's time to set up your email signature.\nThere are several key advantages of using an email signature in your engagement emails.\nGaining trust: The recipient can easily identify who has contacted them and from which company. If they want to research you before replying, they can do that.\nProviding context and building rapport: Your title and company name help indicate the nature and reason for your message. If you or your company are well-known in the industry, your signature may even add credibility to your email.\nEncouraging responses: If you include your contact information in the email, you increase the chances of a response. You also give the recipient the freedom to respond through the channel that suits them best.\nTo set up a unique signature for each mailbox that you have linked, follow the steps in this article.\nSPAM Filters and Links\nPlease note, as a best practice, you should avoid including links in your signature because they may trigger SPAM filters for new contacts that you have not emailed before. For more information, please refer to the \"Avoid SPAM Filters\" Overview article.\nBack to Top\nPlan Your Outreach Campaign (Sequence)\nNow that you have integrated your CRM, connected your mailbox, and set up your email signature, you are ready to start planning your outreach campaign.\nBefore you create and execute your sequences in Apollo, ask yourself 3 key questions:\nWho do you want to target and why?\nWhen do you want to target them?\nWhat steps will you take to engage with them?\nIf you haven't already done so, follow the instructions in the Use Apollo to Find New Customers use case to identify the answers to the first and second questions.\nBelow, we will focus on the third point\u2014the steps you should take once you have identified your Ideal Customer Profile, built your Personas, and are ready for engagement.\nBack to Top\nCreate a Sequence\nApollo sequences are outreach campaigns with any number of sequential contact points and tasks that you can customize to personally engage your target audiences at scale. They help your team deliver communications to your customers and complete the right tasks at the right time to speed your prospects through your pipeline and turn them into paying customers as efficiently as possible.\nAs you use Apollo to hone in on your Ideal Customer Profiles, you can create sequences to match each type of prospect with automatic and manual messages, LinkedIn engagement, calls, and action items that speak directly to the needs and challenges of your target audiences.\nSequence steps are the individual messages and activities you design for your team to successfully engage with prospects. Sequences are made up of as many steps and with as much time between each step as you choose. An ideal outreach campaign requires multiple touches and interactions. You first need to decide upon the type of sales strategy that you want to implement. Is the purpose of your sequence to create demand, to generate pipeline, or to expand upon your existing business? This decision will influence whether you decide to follow an inbound, outbound, nurture-based, event-inspired, upselling, or other sales strategy. Depending on the approach that you choose, the number of steps in your sequence will vary. In most cases, Apollo recommends you follow up with someone at least 5 times.\nStep by Step\nFor more information about the types of steps available in Apollo, please refer to the \"Available Steps in a Sequence\" section of the \"Sequences Overview\" article. You can also refer to this section of the \"Craft Killer Sales Email Messaging\" article for 3 example options to consider when planning your sequence strategy.\nWhen you have strategized the number and types of steps to include in your sequence, you are ready to build these steps within Apollo.\nBack to Top\nDraft Your Messaging\nWe will focus on drafting email messaging in a sequence.

Then, give your template a name.\nContemplating Templates?\nPlease note, you do not have to save your message as a template; however, there are advantages of doing so. For example, you can access template analytics, collaborate and share successful templates with team members, and update templates en masse. For more information about Apollo templates, please refer to the \"Create and Edit Email Templates\" article.\nClick Save Changes.\nApollo saves your message. Repeat this process until you have added the copy for each email in your sequence.\nBack to Top\nAdd Contacts to Your Sequence\nNow that you have your messages at the ready, it's time to add your contacts.\nThere are 3 different ways to add contacts to a sequence in Apollo. You can use the Apollo Search tool, upload a CSV file, or select contacts from a list.\nIt's Your Way or the Highway\nYou can choose to add contacts in the way that best suits you and your team.

For a breakdown of the features available in each Apollo plan, please refer to the pricing page. If you want to upgrade your plan to access open tracking, please reach out to the friendly Apollo sales team for further assistance.\nEmail tracking systems, which inform you when your emails are opened, use a 1-pixel image called a tracking pixel to obtain interaction data. Each tracking pixel contains individualized code to attribute to the recipient and to the email that they receive. Additionally, if the recipient downloads the image, Apollo also logs it as an email open event.\nPixel Tracking Image URL\nApollo's tracking pixel is hosted on Heroku, so that pixel displays as a Heroku URL.\nBack to Top\nOpen Tracking Considerations\nSometimes, email tracking systems mark an email as opened when they are not actually opened. The following scenarios cause false positives:\nIn Outlook, the recipient can view the email from the preview pane. \nThis causes the tracking pixel to download even though they didn't actually click on the email. \nThe email recipient has a Google or G Suite address \nAs Google always proxies every link in an email, they may visit the link as a test.

It is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is possible.\nOn mobile, the Gmail app displays the email on a preview screen. \nThis sometimes triggers an email open event without the user seeing more than just the subject and first few words.\nOn the other hand, false negatives are also possible. This occurs when a contact opened your email and the tracking pixel was not downloaded so it did not trigger an open event. If your contact has set their email to not download images automatically, you may get incomplete data.\nThe easiest way to combat this and improve your open data is to include a clickable link in your email. This ensures that anyone who clicked your link opened and read your message.\nTry Turning it Off and On Again!\nPlease note, if you make changes to an active sequence, you need to turn it off and then on again to activate the changes.\nBack to Top\nEnhance Open Rates with A\/B Testing\nA\/B Testing helps to increase your open rates. By sending multiple versions of the same email, you can analyze the data to discover which version the recipients find most engaging. Use this data to tweak your messaging and enhance your open rates.\nRead Add an A\/B Test to an Email Step in a Sequence for more information.\nBack to Top\nLow Open Rate Concerns\nMore often than not, low open rates for your emails are the direct result of bad deliverability and issues with your domain's reputation.\nSome email providers may report emails as successfully delivered, but instead, move them to a contact's SPAM folder. That means a contact never actually viewed or opened the email. If a contact doesn't view your email, open rates remain low.\nTo help avoid emails blocked by SPAM filters, please see the Avoid SPAM Filters article to review Apollo's suggestions for improving your domain's reputation.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"How Do I Write Effective Sales Emails? \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nEmail is a powerful sales tool. When done correctly, sales emails can help you raise awareness, build rapport and convert qualified leads into sales opportunities at scale. There are several best practices you can follow to increase your email conversion rates.\nRefer to the steps below to learn how to write effective sales emails.\nBack to Top\nUnderstand the Pain Points of Your Target Audience\nEvery 60 seconds, around 197.6 million emails are sent. Before you write a sales email, ask yourself 3 important questions:\nWhat challenges are your ideal customers facing?\nHow can you help them overcome their biggest challenges?\nWhy should they care about what you have to say?\nYou need to speak in your ideal customer's language, focus each email on one of their biggest needs or concerns, and ensure you provide content of value. Make sure you answer relevant questions in the content of your emails. Your readers need to be able to identify the reason for your email right away.\nTurn generic terms, such as \"better\" and \"faster\" into specific outcomes, such as \"our company can increase sales by 20%.\" The more relevant, specific, and quantifiable your statements are, the more impactful your messages will be.\nBack to Top\nMake It Personal\nIt is only when you fully understand the needs and concerns of your ideal customers that you can personalize your emails effectively. Before you write a single message, you first need to segment your customers into smaller groups that share the same key characteristics and challenges.\nFollow the recommendations below to reach the right audience, with the right message, at the right time:\nSet the goals for your campaign(s) and decide the parameters by which you will segment your ideal customers.\nUse Search Filters when prospecting to find the specific contacts and accounts that fit your criteria for a certain campaign.\nCreate your key Buyer Personas, identify their defining characteristics and determine their biggest pain points. This information should frame the content of the emails in every sequence.\nBuild Lists to segment your target contacts and accounts into the appropriate categories.\nCreate Sequences with highly targeted messaging that speaks directly to each of your buyer persona's specific needs.\nUse Sequence Statistics to analyze and refine your segmentation tactics and further personalize your approach.\nWhen you are ready to write your emails, let your audience know that you see and hear them. Speak to their needs by making your messages relatable, personalized, and clear.\nBack to Top\nCreate Intrigue in the Subject Line\nSubject lines hold the key to high open rates. Keep it short, create intrigue, and make it personal.\nLength: Try to capture your message in as few words as possible. Between 10 and 60 characters is ideal.\nIntrigue: Leave your reader wanting more. Relate to their key interests or concerns, offer value, and create a fear of loss.\nPersonalization: Avoid generic terms and phrases. Instead, use {{company}} snippets to personalize your approach and give your emails a more human touch.\nSubject Line Taboo\nAlthough personalization is important, try to stay away from first name snippets in the subject line. While {{company}} name snippets tend to increase open rates, email servers often flag as SPAM any subject lines that include {{first_name}} snippets.\nHere are some examples of effective subject lines:\nIdea for {{company}}\n{{company}} + [Your Company Name]\nHow competitive is {{company}}\u2019s Sales team?\n10x {{company}}\u2019s traction in 10 minutes\nQuestion about Employee Loyalty at {{company}}\nA\/B Test with Apollo\nPlease note, every industry, niche, and target audience is different. Follow best practices as a starting point, but make sure you A\/B Test your subject lines to improve your open rates and uncover what works best for your specific niche.\nBack to Top\nKeep it Simple and Concise\nAttention spans are short so be concise and get straight to the point. Your ideal customers are not interested in your life story. They want to know why your message is beneficial to them. If they don't see value immediately, your email will end up in the trash folder. So keep to one focal point per email and make your message digestible.\nSimplicity is also key in sales emails. You need to strike a balance between approachable, casual, and informative. Don't overcomplicate or provide too much detail. Keep your emails clean, concise, and conversational. Avoid bullet points and heavy punctuation, make your point clear, and provide just enough value to spark their interest and leave them wanting more.\nBack to Top\nInclude A Powerful CTA\nA CTA (Call-to-Action) is a question, link, or button that draws immediate attention to the offer or focus of your email and encourages the reader to take action.\nCTAs should be easy to spot, action-oriented, thoughtful, and persuasive.\nFollow the tactics below to engage with your readers and encourage a response:\nMention a specific time or date to make it easier for your contact to commit to a meeting. For example:\nAre you available for a call on {{now_weekday->plus_1}} \nor {{now_weekday->plus_2}}?\"\nCan you touch base on a call this week?\nLet's talk. How does this {{now_weekday->plus_1}} work \nfor you, {{first_name}}?\nBe polite but persistent:\nHave you given any thought to my last email, \n{{first_name}}?\nAre you still the best person to talk to about \n[topic]? If not, who would you recommend I speak to?\nWhat are your thoughts about the proposal?\nBe helpful:\nDo you have any questions at all?\nWant me to run you through your options?\nDoes it still make sense for us to sync up?\nGive context:\nCan I share a [short video] about \n[overcoming related pain point], {{first_name}}?\nClick here to discover, engage, and convert your ideal \ncustomers.\nGot 15 minutes to talk about [topic]?\nAdd Urgency:\nSign up now.\nHow much time does it currently take your team to do \n[X task]?\nReply by EOW to receive your discount.\nBack to Top\nAdd Multiple Touchpoints\nEvery point of contact that you make in a campaign is a touchpoint. This refers to email, LinkedIn, call, voicemail, SMS, etc. The ideal number of touchpoints that you should make per contact in any given campaign will vary depending on the type of buyer personas, the stage they are in the sales cycle, and the specific industries with which you engage.\nNo matter the circumstances, don't give up after the first hurdle. You need to nurture your prospects, provide valuable content, and have confidence in your approach. Remember the reason why you are contacting your ideal customers and the value that your product or services can bring to them.\nTouch Points\nOn average, 5-8 touches is a good place to start\u2014provided you segment your leads correctly and share a clear, valuable message with every touch. Don't forget to A\/B Test though. Analyzing the data will help you to find the ideal number of touchpoints for each specific campaign you run.\nBack to Top\nLearn When And How To Link\nIn an outbound campaign, you start as a stranger to those whom you are contacting. You need to build trust and prove that your message is worth the readers' time before you can expect them to click on any content you send.\nIf you want your readers to open the links you share, provide context and entice them. Use short, action-oriented CTAs and give them a rough idea of what they will gain from clicking. Refer to the example below:\nClick here to find out how Coder achieved a 50x ROI \nwithin one month using Apollo.\nAvoid SPAM\nPlease note, you should keep the number of links down to 1 or 2 maximum per email or your bounce rate may rise. In the first touch email, it's very important to avoid sending any links, attachments, or images as the recipient's server is more likely to flag you as SPAM.\nBack to Top\nAvoid SPAM Triggers in Your Email Content\nTo improve delivery rates and avoid email servers flagging your sales emails as SPAM, there are several content best practices that you can follow:\nTry not to over-promise or sensationalize the information in your emails. Avoid words and phrases such as cost, payment, earn, buy direct, and make money.\nSPAM Trigger Words\nFor a more detailed list of words and phrases to avoid in your emails, refer to this HubSpot Article.\nRemove unnecessary links from the body of your email and your signature. It's especially important to avoid links in a first-touch email.\nDo not include images or attachments in the body of your email unless it is 100% necessary. Again, this is especially important in first-touch emails.\nKeep your paragraphs concise. Long content can activate SPAM blockers.\nA\/B test your messaging to discover which versions of your emails have the lowest bounce rate.\nAvoid SPAM Filters\nPlease refer to the Avoid SPAM Filters article for a more comprehensive look at how to improve the delivery rates for the emails that you send through Apollo.\nBack to Top\nA\/B Test\nWhat works for others may not work for you and your target audience. The best way to determine the most effective sales messaging for your campaigns is to let the data do the talking. A\/B Testing allows you to test multiple messages in a sequence step. With more than one email template per step, you can analyze and leverage the data to tweak your messaging and improve the effectiveness of future emails.\nBack to top"}

{"Topic":"Why Didn't My Email Send? \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nYou can send emails manually, through sequences, or in plays. If you're having issues with email delivery, a few troubleshooting steps can help.\nSeveral factors can impact whether emails sent in Apollo arrive in a contact's inbox. In general, Apollo characterizes email delivery issues into 3 main groups:\nApollo hasn't scheduled or delivered any of your emails.\nApollo sent your emails, but they failed to deliver.\nApollo hasn't attempted to send your emails.\nRefer to the following sections to learn how to resolve email delivery issues.\nBack to Top\nApollo Hasn't Scheduled or Delivered Any of Your Emails\nIf you added contacts to a sequence, but Apollo hasn't scheduled or delivered any of your emails, there are 3 possible causes:\nYou haven't activated the sequence.\nYou haven't activated the steps in the sequence.\nYou need to update the wait time between steps.\nA sequence email requires manual review.\nActivate Sequence\nEnsure you activated the sequence associated with the email you expected to send. To activate your sequence:\nLaunch Apollo and click Engage > Sequences.\nToggle the sequence on. \nActivate the Sequence Steps\nEnsure you activated the sequence step associated with the email you expected to send. To activate sequence steps:\nLaunch Apollo and click Engage > Sequences.\nClick the sequence that you need to review.\nToggle the sequence steps on. \nVerify Wait Time Between Steps\nCheck the wait time between each sequence step associated with the email you expected to send. To verify wait time:\nLaunch Apollo and click Engage > Sequences.\nClick the sequence that you need to review.\nCheck the wait time shown to the right of each step. Apollo won't send your contacts any emails until this time has passed. \nTo edit the wait time, click [. . .] > Edit. \nUse the When to start this step option to adjust the wait time between steps. \nWhen finished, click Continue.\nAn Email Requires Manual Review\nIf you configure a manual email step in a sequence, the email won't send automatically.

If your deliverability scores are good, there are 3 possible causes for email delivery issues:\nThe email bounced.\nThe emails haven't been sent.\nBack to Top\nBounced Emails\nIf an email bounces, it means that the recipient's email address no longer exists or there's an error in the recipient's information. When this happens, the email is returned and the email status is updated to Bounced.\nBack to Top\nNot Sent\nIf you tried the troubleshooting steps in this article, but you're still having issues with emails not delivering, check out the following table for possible solutions:\nReason Explanation Solution \nBlocked Contact Stage\tWhen you create a sequence, you have the option to mark emails as Not Sent when a contact is in a selected contact stage through a sequence ruleset. If you then try to send an email to a contact in one of the selected stages, Apollo won't send the email.\tYou can change the stage of a contact that you want to email, or you can change the settings in the sequence ruleset so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to contacts in the stage. After making this change, try sending the email again.\t\nBlocked Account Stage\tWhen you create a sequence, you have the option to mark emails as Not Sent when an account is in a selected account stage through a sequence ruleset. If you try to send an email to an account that is in one of the selected stages, Apollo won't send the email.\tYou can change the stage of a specific account that you want to email, or you can change the settings in the sequence ruleset so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to any accounts in the stage. After making this change, try sending the email again.\t\nSame Account Replied\tIf you set a sequence rule not to send when another contact from the same account replies in any sequence, Apollo won't send the email.\tUpdate the settings in the sequence ruleset, then send the email again.\t\nUnverified Email\tIf it's your first time sending an email to a contact with an unverified email, Apollo won't send the email as a failsafe.\tUnverified emails have a 60-80% success rate. Try sending the email again.\t\nMissing Snippet\tIf you include snippets in a message and the contact you want to email doesn't have a value for the snippet, Apollo won't send the email.\tEdit the contact's profile to add a value for the missing field. Alternatively, change the snippet to an advanced snippet and add a fallback for this type of scenario.\t\nMissing Dynamic Variable\tIf you used dynamic variables in a message and the contact you want to email doesn't have a value for a dynamic variable, Apollo won't send the email.\tTo fix the issue, edit the contact's profile to add a value for the missing field. Alternatively, change the dynamic variable to an advanced dynamic variable and add a fallback for this type of scenario.\t\nMissing Thread Info\tIf you set the email type as \"Reply to a Previous Thread\" and the contact deletes the previous email, Apollo won't send the email.\tYou can send this contact a manual email. To ensure the next emails in the sequence are sent, adjust any other emails in the sequence to send as part of a new thread.\t\nNo Send From Mailbox Selected\tWhen you add contacts to a sequence, you must assign a mailbox. If one of your teammates removes a mailbox to which you linked your contacts in the sequence, Apollo won't send the email.\tYou can update an existing mailbox or link the sequence to another mailbox.\t\nEmail Missing or Invalid\tIf you added a contact with no email address to your sequence, Apollo won't send the email.\tUpdate the email address on the contact's profile. When the information is up-to-date, resend the message.\t\nContact Account Not Owned by User\tYou might only have permissions to send emails to the contacts you own. If you try to email another user's contact or account, Apollo won't send the email.\tRe-assign ownership of the contact, or ask an Apollo admin to change your permissions so you can send emails to other users' contacts and accounts.\t\nEmail Service Provider Error\tIf a contact's email server is unable to deliver the email and returns an error to Apollo, Apollo can't send the message.\tHover your mouse over the \"Email Service Provider Error\" in Apollo to find out more about the error. Use this information to troubleshoot email delivery, or reach out to Apollo Support.\t\nOther\tIf an email fails to deliver for any other reason, Apollo shows an Other error.\tReach out to Apollo Support for assistance.\t\nBack to Top\nApollo Has Not Attempted to Send Your Emails\nIf Apollo hasn't tried to send your emails, there are 2 possible reasons for this:\nAn admin in your team has deleted the user associated with the contacts in your sequence. To solve this issue, you need to re-assign ownership of the contacts, and then send the email again.\nThe time or date you scheduled the email to send has already passed.

{"Topic":"Follow Apollo's Cold Calling Best Practices \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nCold calling enables you to connect with prospects who might not engage in other channels. Leading sales experts show that dialing prospects is one of the fastest ways to book meetings.\nCheck Your Plan\nThe availability of certain features that are useful in cold calling is subject to your Apollo plan. Refer to Apollo's pricing page for more details.\nThe following sections outline some general best practices for cold calling with Apollo.\nBack to Top\nFilter Prospects\nThoroughly filtering contacts before cold calling increases the likelihood that you are dialing qualified prospects. There are several ways to narrow your list of cold call candidates in Apollo:\nTarget recommended contacts. Apollo provides these contacts based on the personas you create, which means they likely match the criteria you seek.\nUse demographics search filters. You can apply multiple filters to your contact searches, including job titles, locations, company size, and revenue. Utilize search filters to identify prospects that match your ideal customer profile (ICP).\nUse the Phone Status\/Confidence search filter. With this filter, you can search your saved contacts to find those with valid phone numbers. This is particularly useful when you have [added your saved contacts to a sequence](#incorporate-cold-calling-into-a-larger-strategy).\nAdd buying intent topics. Buying intent helps you understand which companies are actively researching topics related to your product.\nIdentify website visitors. Track companies that visit your websites by adding an Apollo-provided JavaScript snippet, then filter prospects based on whether they have visited your web properties.\nAvoid high-risk phone numbers. Apollo warns you if you attempt to purchase a high-risk number. Excluding contacts with these numbers from your cold calling strategy improves your call quality and prevents your number from being marked as spam. However, you should not rule out these leads entirely, so consider adding them to an emails-only sequence.\nBack to Top\nScript Your Calls\nCold calls typically last less than a few minutes, and unscripted conversation can leave a prospect feeling you weren't prepared to talk with them. To ensure your calls are successful, you will want to prepare some general dialogue.\nBefore you dial, write and rehearse a short cold calling script like the following example that you can use both for live calls and voicemails. Try to use your own voice and make the dialogue sound natural, but adhere to the general structure. Don't make your script too complicated. The goal of a cold call is to connect briefly with a prospect and move them to a more formal meeting.\nThe Opener\nThe first 10 seconds of your call should be used to ask for their attention for the next 30 seconds-2 minutes so you can introduce the topic of the call.\nHi [PROSPECT\u2019S NAME], this is [YOUR NAME] from [YOUR COMPANY]. How have you been?\n\nI know we didn't plan this call. Do you mind if quickly walk you through why I called,\nand you can let me know if you think it's worth a follow-up call?\nThe Hook\nIf they agree to continue the conversation, the next 30 seconds-2 minutes should be used to introduce the topic and engage in a short exchange to uncover their pain points. Draw attention to the prospect's role and company so they know you are targeting them, not just pitching anyone that answers your calls.\nI noticed that you are the head of [PROSPECT'S ROLE] at [PROSPECT'S COMPANY]. \n\nI want to introduce [YOUR COMPANY\/PRODUCT]. It can provide [VALUE PROPOSITION] to \nyour company.\nThe Close\nEnd the call with an accepted next step. Ideally, this will be a scheduled 15-30 minutes to more thoroughly discuss the pain points that you uncovered.\nDo you think [YOUR PRODUCT] could be helpful in solving your team's challenges in 2024?\n[WAIT FOR PROSPECT'S ANSWER]\n\nGreat! Let's put down 30 minutes on your calendar for a walkthrough. How does your \ncalendar look over the next week?\nFor more cold call scripting inspiration, refer to 6 Winning Cold Calling Scripts that Actually Book Meetings To learn more about cold calling generally, check out the How to Build Pipeline with Cold Calling lesson in Apollo Academy.\nBook Me!\nHave a prospect that wants to move forward? Set up meetings in Apollo to make it quick and easy to book time on your calendar. You can email the prospect a link that enables them to select an available time slot based on the rules you set.\nBack to Top\nLeave Voicemails\nWhen cold calls are not answered, leaving a voicemail is standard practice. Voicemails signal to contacts that they are important to you, and that you are a real person making a genuine attempt to connect.\nAs with a cold call, you should also script your voicemails to both make your voicemails more effective and to stand out against competitors. A well-scripted voicemail serves as a high-quality touch in the sales process, and is more likely to lead to callbacks from contacts. Your cold call script can serve as the basis for your voicemail script.\nAlso, do not fear dialing personal mobile numbers instead of office numbers when leaving voicemails. Assuming you adhere to regulations, many sales experts experience more success dialing personal numbers, especially with hybrid and remote work arrangements on the rise.\nBack to Top\nPractice Objection Handling\nContacts have reasons why they are not interested in hearing more about your product, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are not good prospects. Better objection handling enables you to move calls beyond typical prospect objections and book more meetings.\nTo improve your objection handling skills:\nPractice your responses to the most common objections you'll hear on cold calls. The following table provides some example responses you can use to handle common objections.\nResearch the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors' products so you can better differentiate them from your own products.\nConduct informal A\/B testing to determine which responses are most successful, then iterate on those responses to improve them.\nPractice the following example responses to common objections:\nObjection\tPhrase You Hear\tResponse Examples\t\nNot interested\t\"I'm not interested. Thanks.\"\t\"That makes sense. Most people aren't interested the first time I call. When do you see an evaluation or project involving [YOUR TYPE OF PRODUCT] coming up?\"\n\"I didn't expect you to be interested today.

Can you see yourself falling in that range, or is this way too expensive?\"\t\nBack to Top\nAdhere to Regulations\nYou should take steps to avoid your calls being marked as spam, including following Twilio's recommendations for maintaining caller reputation. Caller reputation is effectively a scoring system that determines whether your calls are at risk of being screened or blocked as spam and helps you maintain a positive caller reputation. The calls made by a phone number determine the caller reputation. To maintain a positive caller reputation, Apollo recommends:\nCheck the US Do Not Call Registry and the UK Telephone Preference Service (TPS), and avoid calling numbers on these lists unless you have a permitted reason. Enable DNC list screening in Apollo to help you stay compliant.\nRemove outdated\/disconnected phone numbers from your call list. Additionally, if Apollo has notified you that a contact has requested to be removed from the Apollo database, you should not contact them unless you have a separate legal basis to do so.\nKeep your outbound call volume steady, and ramp up outbound call volume gradually. Unusual spikes in volume can lead to a number being marked as spam.\nMake calls within common working hours for the area you are dialing, and do not repeatedly dial the same phone number.\nYou should also comply with the following regulations:\nTCPA rules: The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) outlines several rules that businesses must follow when contacting consumers via phone. The TCPA includes restrictions around telemarketing, such as requiring express written consent from prospects before making telemarketing calls with automated dialers or artificial or prerecorded messages, among other regulations.\nFCC regulations: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is a US government agency that regulates a variety of communications, including phone communications. The FCC provides tips to consumers that want to avoid robocalls and scams, which means you can use the same tips to avoid being considered spam. For example, do not ask a prospect for personal information, do not pressure them, and use known phone numbers to make calls.\nTwilio Acceptable Use Policy: Apollo\u2019s provider\u2019s policy outlines several rules regarding call content, prohibited activities, and other restrictions that you should follow when cold calling.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that any cold call you make from the Apollo dialer is compliant with the law.\nBack to Top\nAnalyze Call Performance\nApollo provides an analytics dashboard that details call performance across the team:\nFrontline sales reps and AEs: Identify the reps that make the most effective calls, then listen to recordings of their calls to learn how to improve.\nSales leaders: Determine which types of contacts are engaging with your team's calls, then adjust your strategy to prioritize those types of contacts. Also, use this data to perform A\/B testing across the team. For example, provide a call script to half the team and a different call script to the other half, then review the data to determine which script performs better.\nTo access this data, launch Apollo and click Analytics, then click the Call engagement performance dashboard.\nYou can also record calls with the Apollo dialer. To access recordings, launch Apollo and click Calls.\nDifferent roles should utilize call recordings in different ways:\nFrontline sales reps and AEs: Listen to call recordings from high-performing teammates to glean cold-calling tips and improve your own call strategy.\nSales leaders: Listen to recordings from across your sales teams to identify coaching opportunities for individual reps.\nSome US states and countries require that all call participants consent to recording calls, so Apollo recommends that you obtain this consent before using the recording functionality.\nBack to Top\nIncorporate Cold Calling Into A Larger Strategy\nMaking cold calls is just one aspect of a multi-touch, multi-channel sales strategy. Each prospect is more or less likely to engage based on your outreach method. That means, in addition to dialing, you should be engaging contacts via email, social media, and other avenues, with the goal of reaching contacts in where they are most likely to engage.\nBuilding a multi-channel sales strategy means keeping track of the various touchpoints being used to reach contacts. Create sequences in Apollo to plan and execute a multi-touch sales strategy, then add your contacts to a sequence. Sequences enable you to set the appropriate contact points and timing for specific types of prospects, then track and complete tasks for each contact from the same area of Apollo.\nBy using sequences, you can also access data to iterate your sales strategy. For example, add A\/B testing for your emails to better understand the types of content that your prospects prefer.\nBack to Top\nLearn More\nWant to become a master of cold calling?

{"Topic":"Avoid High-Risk Numbers in Your Sales Outreach \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nThe most effective outreach strategies almost always include phone calls. Engaging your prospects in meaningful conversation is a core component of building quality pipeline and converting leads. However, if you want your outreach strategy to succeed, you must follow calling best practices even before you dial.\nKnowing how to avoid high-risk numbers in your outreach is essential. Among other factors, it can help:\nIncrease call quality.\nPrevent your number from being marked as spam.\nReduce your number of dropped calls.\nRefer to the following sections for more information on high-risk numbers and the best practices you can follow to keep your dialing habits healthy.\nBack to Top\nIdentify High-Risk Numbers\nHigh-risk numbers are the numbers you call with a higher probability of triggering low engagement, resulting in spam traps, and putting the health of your number at risk.\nThey typically include numbers such as:\nToll fraud risk numbers: These numbers encourage spam calls and are often part of fraud schemes where the owners receive revenue for every minute of the call.\nSpecial service numbers: These numbers include premium, shared-cost, and other special service numbers. Owners often charge higher rates when the call connects.\nIf you dial these types of \"premium\", often fraudulent numbers in your outreach, you put the health and credibility of your number at risk, burn through phone credits, and experience a much lower call quality on the whole.\nHigh-Risk Locations\nThere is no clear-cut list of countries you should avoid calling in your outreach. Most regions have at least some high-risk numbers. The level of risk in each location can also vary depending on which country you and your team are calling from.\nDespite this, Apollo is committed to helping you keep your caller reputation safe and avoid high-risk numbers within your outreach. Apollo partners with the industry-leading, third-party provider Twilio to integrate voice calls in Apollo.\nThrough a sophisticated analysis mechanism, which leverages anti-fraud databases and millions of communication data points, Twilio consistently identifies and updates a list of high-risk number ranges. Apollo monitors this list and deactivates risky regions to help protect your account.\nLow Engagement\nMany varying factors influence the risk level of a number. Make sure you closely monitor your call performance and keep an eye on low engagement rates. If you notice any negative trends within specific regions, consider excluding said locations from your outreach entirely.\nIf your total addressable market is exclusive to a very narrow set of locations and excluding regions from your outreach is not an option, consider using a third-party validation tool to cross-check any numbers within locations where you've seen a low engagement rate.\nThe more you analyze your call data, take precautions, and adapt your strategy based on what is and isn't working for your team, the higher your engagement will be, and the less likely your numbers will fall victim to fraudulent spam traps.\nBack to Top\nIdentify High-Risk Numbers in Apollo\nWhen Apollo identifies high-risk numbers, it informs you. This means that you can take action to exclude these numbers from your outreach and keep your calling reputation safe.\nThere are two scenarios in which Apollo warns you of high-risk numbers:\nBefore purchasing the contact's number when prospecting. \nBefore attempting to call the number from the dialer. \nIf you have already purchased the number, you can also see the high-risk badge:\nFrom a contact's profile page \nFrom your active tasks\u2014if you've scheduled any upcoming calls to contacts with high-risk numbers.\nNobody Likes Spam!\nPlease keep in mind that the more high-risk numbers you call, the more likely your number will be marked as spam. Apollo strongly recommends you don't call high-risk numbers inside or outside of Apollo. Even if a number is enabled within the Apollo dialer, Apollo encourages you not to call the number unless it is absolutely necessary.\nApollo classifies high-risk numbers into 3 buckets:\nDialing Like a Boss!\nReady to get dialing but looking for industry-leading calling tips to help you and your team strengthen your pipeline? Check out this video on perfecting the cold call for more guidance.\nBack to Top\nLeverage Apollo Features to Improve Your Connection Rates\nThere are several actions you can take in Apollo to help increase call engagement rates and avoid spam traps:\nAvoid calling high-risk numbers: Apollo informs you when it identifies a high-risk number. Heed the advice and consider contacting the prospect via another channel instead. You can create messaging-only sequences and engage with these prospects via email and LinkedIn.\nMake VOIP calls: Once you've configured the dialer, make Voice Over IP calls instead of using your phone. If you encounter any issues, switch to a new number. Depending on your plan, you can request up to 5 new numbers per month in Apollo. If you're calling contacts in international regions, keep a close eye on performance per country and make changes to your strategy if you notice any negative trends.\nFollow best practices: Stay compliant and follow caller best practices to maintain a positive reputation. Create and use call purposes and call dispositions in Apollo to generate more precise data and filter your calls to more easily identify trends. Ensure you log all calls accurately and empower your team to follow suit.\nLeverage Apollo analytics: Keep an eye on your recent call activity from the control center, create custom dashboards and reports to monitor call performance, and tailor the data you gather according to your priorities. If you don't want to create a dashboard from scratch, you can also leverage the Apollo template: Call Engagement Performance to view and analyze call engagement in your team. If you spot anomalies, take action to adapt your strategy, increase engagement rates, and protect your caller reputation.\nBack to top\nTry It Out In Apollo\nThere's No Time Like the Present!\nFeeling more confident about high-risk numbers and the steps you can take in Apollo to avoid those pesky digits in your sales outreach?

If you enable Bridge calls for outgoing or incoming phone calls, you must enter your personal phone number. Bridge calls are only available for US phone numbers. International dialing is not supported with Bridge.\nIncoming Calls: Contacts need to call your Apollo phone number for the call to be bridged to your personal phone number. Voicemails are left on your phone's mailbox, assuming that you have configured a voicemail box for your phone.\nOutgoing Calls: You will receive a call to your personal phone number from your Apollo number. This call will prompt you to complete the bridge by interacting with your dialer. This sends the given contact a phone call from your Apollo number.\nBridged Calls And Your Personal Phone Number\nPlease note, Apollo will never send the call to your contact from your personal phone number.\nVoIP (Voice over IP) allows you to place or receive calls in your browser via your Apollo phone number. This provides you with the same click-to-call and call recording functionality as the Bridge option, but there is no voicemail feature.\nRecording Voicemails\nPlease note, Apollo phone numbers are not associated with voicemail boxes. If you would like to receive voicemails for incoming calls, please use the Bridge option rather than VoIP. Bridge is not available for international numbers and calls.\nBack to Top\nConfigure Outgoing Calls\nSelect Call Type\nLaunch Apollo and navigate to Settings.\nClick Voice from the \"You\" section.\nFrom the \"Outgoing Call\" dropdown, select how you would like to make outgoing calls.\nIf you select Bridge, outgoing calls will be made via the phone number that you add to the text box.\nUse Your Own Number\nPlease note, you must use your own phone number if you select the Bridge option. If you use a number that you don't have access to, Bridge will not work.\nIf you select VoIP, outgoing calls will be received in your browser.\nBack to Top\nConfigure Incoming Calls\nSelect Call Type\nLaunch Apollo and navigate to Settings.\nClick Voice from the \"You\" section.\nFrom the \"Incoming Call\" dropdown, select how you would like to receive incoming calls.\nIf you select Bridge, incoming calls will be received via the phone number that you add to the text box.\nUse Your Own Number\nPlease note, you must use your own phone number if you select the Bridge option.

That\u2019s ok! If you aren\u2019t aware of the details you need to fill in your Product Market Fit Canvas, you should take a look at your current customer data. You can leverage this data to find patterns that you can then use to describe each of these segments.\nAsk yourself the following questions:\nIs there a particular vertical that pops up frequently in your closed deals?\nAre there any trends related to the size of the companies who buy your product or service or their proximity to a funding round?\nDo the people that most frequently buy your product sit in a particular department or hold a specific title?\nPosing these kinds of questions helps you to find patterns in your customer data that you can use to fill in your Product Market Fit Canvas and reach out to the prospects who are most likely to buy.\nUltimately, what you\u2019re trying to do is discover your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). If this sounds like a foreign language to you, fear not! We have a resource to help you build your first ICP:\nIdentify Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)\nUse Apollo to Find New Customers\nIn the section below, we provide an example of how to apply Apollo\u2019s customer data to a Product Market Fit Canvas and how you can leverage that information to find prospects in the Apollo platform.\nBack to Top\nUse Apollo To Target Your Prospects\nAfter analyzing some historic customer data and determining our ICP, we concluded that we have two primary Company and Title segments that we should use for targeting.\nData Point A B \nWho: Company\tSMB Startups\tMid-MArket Recruiting Agencies\t\nWho: Titles\tFounders\tDirector of Business Development\t\nNow that we have that information, we can use it directly in the Apollo platform. Each column or Segment in our Product Market Fit Canvas represents a different outreach campaign that we will create in the Apollo platform.\nLet\u2019s take a look at Segment A. Here, we can see that \u201cSMB Startups\u201d are one type of company we should dig into. This description doesn\u2019t give us a specific vertical with which to start. However, it does tell us that we should be looking at companies with fewer than 1000 employees who are also in the early stages of their business. Perhaps they\u2019ve gone through a funding round in the last year or two. Once a company has raised its initial funding and has done two or more rounds of large venture capital or private equity investment, they\u2019re not typically considered a start-up anymore and we can rule out any company that meets that criteria.\nYou might be saying to yourself, \u201dI\u2019ve got this information\u2014now what?\u201d\nApollo offers numerous built-in targets to help you find the right people for your outbound campaigns. We have extensive documentation about each filter type available on the Apollo Knowledge Base:\nSearch Filters Overview\nWe created an Apollo Search with filters that include a pre-defined range of 51-1000 for the number of employees and funding rounds of Seed, Angel, Venture, and Series A.\nThis has given us a total of about 9,000 companies we can dig into. We\u2019ll create a Saved Search for these companies so we can come back to them later.\nNext, we need to utilize what we know about the people who are involved in our closed deals to further refine our search. In the interest of reusability and scalability, we can accomplish this by creating a Persona for Founders at SMB Companies.\nWith our Persona created, we\u2019ll return to the Apollo Search tool and load our Saved Search for SMB Startups.\nWe\u2019ll batch select some of the companies from our list. Then, we\u2019ll click Find People to launch a new Apollo Search for the people who work at the selected companies.\nNow that we have a list of everyone who works at the selected companies, it\u2019s time to apply the Persona that we previously created to find the actual targets for our outreach campaign.\nWe now have a list of real people that match our Product Market Fit Canvas criteria. Since we will want to reach out to these people in a sequence later, we\u2019ll save them to a List so they\u2019re easier to find.\nWe\u2019ll repeat this process for Segment B. This means that we will have two new cohorts that we can reach out to in individualized outreach campaigns.\nBack to Top\nPractical Exercise\nAnalyze your book of business to discover customer trends. As we mentioned in the Setting the Scene section, you should ask yourself a series of questions to help identify the types of companies and the people who work at them who are most likely to buy your product or service. Ask yourself the following questions and then use that information to fill in your Product Market Fit Canvas:\nWhat industries or verticals do your customers most frequently belong to?\nWhat is the average company size for your current customers?\nWhat do the technology stacks look like for your customers? Are there any similarities between the companies that you\u2019ve closed?\nDoes geography play a factor in the deals that you\u2019ve closed? For instance, are most of your customers based in Latin America?\nDo any of the roles for your current customers appear more often than others?\nWhat title seniorities are most frequently involved in your closed deals?\nGot To Start Somewhere!\nThese questions are only a starting point. You shouldn\u2019t shy away from digging into your data to find different trends and patterns across your customer base. Get creative. Get weird. The more time you spend refining your targeting, the more likely you will be successful when you start your customer outreach.\nOnce you have enough data to fill in the targeting portion of your Product Market Fit Canvas, you should consider creating Personas in the Apollo platform so you have them ready when you start building Sequences.\nBack to Top\nNext Steps\nNow that we have identified the companies and individuals that we want to target, we need to carefully craft our messaging in order to maximize our chances of making sales.

{"Topic":"Build an Outbound Sales Process: Monitor Your Analytics \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Setting the Scene\n\u201cTry again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201d \u2014Samuel Becket\nSales may not have been Samuel Beckett\u2019s vocation, but these 6 simple words certainly resonate with the world of outbound sales. The science of sales analytics boils down to 2 fundamental components: experimentation and testing. What works on one target audience may not work on another. What worked in the past, may not still work in the present. Outbound sales is a fluid process that thrives when you are constantly innovating. If you want to succeed long-term, you need to use the data at your disposal to drive smart decision-making.\nSales analytics provide you with the insights that you need to identify key trends and define what is and isn\u2019t working. You can also use them to decide which tests to run and which improvements to make in order to repeatedly smash your monthly and yearly targets on a consistent basis.\nThere are 4 main facets of effective sales analytics:\nDescriptive Sales Analytics: Study past sales data such as \u201c% Email Open Rate,\u201d \u201c# of Meetings Set,\u201d and the other sales metrics that you decided to track in the module Build an Outbound Sales Process: Metrics, to identify key trends in your current approach.\nDiagnostic Sales Analytics: Deep dive into your sales metrics to draw conclusions as to why outcomes may have happened. Could a sudden increase or decrease in meetings set be due to the time of day or year that you are reaching out? Could a drop in open rates mean that your subject line needs work, or that your domain is at risk? The more you question and analyze your existing approach, the easier it is to replicate your successes and reduce risks.\nPredictive Sales Analytics: Learn from your historical data to make informed predictions about the future results that you can hope to achieve. Are you setting realistic goals based on the data from your current and previous outreach campaigns?\nPrescriptive Sales Analytics: Evaluate all data to draw up a comprehensive plan of action that will help you take the right steps to continue enhancing your outbound sales process. What actions are you going to take to reach the goals you have set and overcome the challenges you may be facing?\nThe first ingredient to successful sales analytics is volume. There is a fine line between too much interaction and too little. When starting out you need a big enough sample size to be able to test different approaches. But you must be careful not to ramp up your efforts too quickly. Do so, and you risk ending up in your contacts\u2019 dreaded SPAM box, with little to show for your efforts except for a sprinkle of regret and a tarnished domain!\nHere are some key sample metrics to aim for when first starting out:\nFunction Metric Benchmark \nTargeting \n# Accounts\n# Contacts per Account\n# Emails per Contact\n\t\n100-1000\n2-5\n2-5\n\t\nActivity \n# Emails\n\t\n200-500 per day\n\t\nQuality of Activity \n% Email Open Rate\n% Email Reply Rate\n% Email Interested Rate\n\t\n30%-50%\n2%-10%\n0.2%-2%\n\t\nResults \n# of Meetings Set\n\t\n20 per month\n\t\nWhen you launch your first campaigns, begin by sending 200 emails per day, per rep. This should give you a large enough sample size to start testing different approaches every day without putting your domain reputation at high risk.\nSPAM!!!\nWorried about SPAM raining on your parade? Patience you must have, my young padawan. In the next module, we cover this topic in more detail.\nAs you test different approaches with each of your target personas, you can use the open, reply, and interest rates from each sequence as a key indicator to gauge whether or not you are targeting the right contacts and accounts, with the right message, at the right time.\nCheck the results regularly and ask yourself:\nAre you achieving an open rate of at least 30-40%? If not, is your subject line and approach appropriate and relevant to your target audience? Have you considered testing a different target group or trying alternative tactics to gauge more interest from the subject line?\nAre you achieving at least 0.5% email interest rate? If not, have you followed the RRRR messaging approach? Do your words resonate with your target audience? Did you include a call to action that will encourage a response? Did you align your target with your messaging?\nOnce you start to find your footing and your % interest rate rises above 0.5%, you can gradually start to increase the volume of emails you send out per day.\nBack to Top\nUse Apollo to Analyze Your Outbound Sales Approach\nApollo analytics provides you with a variety of metrics and insights into the performance of your sales outreach. For access to the basic metrics from each sequence, you can head to the Sequences page and view the open, reply, and interested rates for every campaign you run.\nOr you can click into a specific sequence and view the metrics for each of the messages within that campaign, as well as the overall results of the sequence.\nIf you want a more holistic view of your results, you can head to Reports and view your funnel on a per contract or per email basis. You can also identify which target audience you currently engage best with and view and compare the metrics per title, seniority, department, and company size to easily identify what does and doesn\u2019t work.\nFinally, for more detailed insights, you can leverage pre-built Apollo Dashboards. From here, you can view the most and least effective sequences, messaging, and steps. You can also visualize which personas, titles, and industries tend to respond best, and you can gain perspective about what does and doesn\u2019t lead to optimal performance and conversion rates.\nBack to Top\nPractical Exercise\nIt\u2019s time to draw your own conclusions! Let\u2019s start by looking at the statistics below:\nAnswer the following questions:\nHow well do you think this sales rep is doing?\nWhich statistic(s) match the industry averages?\nWhich statistic(s) do the rep still need to improve upon?\nIs this rep ready to start increasing the number of emails they send out to 600 per day? \nWhy or why not?\nWhat do you think this rep should test next?\nWait, I Forgot Already\u2014\nThe answers lie within you, but just in case you\u2019re feeling uninspired, they also lie within this page too!

It is no longer a simple matter of personalizing your outreach with a recipient\u2019s name or company name. Outreach emails also need to be relevant. That means that you need to do your due diligence in trying to find as much information about each contact before you reach out to them.\nLinkedIn and the Apollo database both provide a lot of great information about contacts, but it may be worthwhile for you to dig a little deeper. Search the web for any recent publications that the contact may have. Find out what their alma matter is and what role they currently have. This information helps you to craft a strong opening line and shows your recipient that you have done some research so that your outreach doesn\u2019t feel entirely cold.\nOnce you have completed your research, don\u2019t forget to fill in your Product Market Fit Canvas. Conducting this analysis will provide you with the context and purpose you need to write poignant messages that resonate with your target personas.\nA B \nWho: Company SMB Startups\tYC Startups in Current batch\t\nWho: Titles Founders\tFounders\t\nProblem \nNeed more opportunties\nHard to build outbound system from scratch\n\t\nGenerates as much revenue as possible pre-demo, but hard to set up\n\t\nSolution \nAll in One\n200M Contact Database\nEmailing Engine\n\t\nAll in One sales platform for generating opportunities with 200M contacts\nEmailing Engine\n\t\nValue Prop \nBuild a best-practice outbound engine in minutes\n\t\nBuild a best-practice outbound engine in minutes\n\t\nImpact\/Benefits \nGenerate hundreds of qualifeid sales meetings\n\t\nGenerate hundreds of qualified sales meetings and hit their Demo Day goals\n\t\nProof Points 5,000 SMB startups like XYZ do ABC\tHundreds of other YC startups like XYZ do ABC\t\nKnow Your Prospects\nRemember, the more specific and targeted your research is, the better chance you have of establishing a rapport with your prospects.\nWhen you do this at scale, you\u2019ll need a place to store all of this information as it relates to specific contacts. This will make it easier for you to reference in your emails. Apollo allows you to store contact-specific research directly in a custom field that\u2019s available on each contact\u2019s profile.\nYou can create custom fields to store research for Accounts in Apollo:\nBack to Top\nDetermine Appropriate References\nReferences help to demonstrate to your email recipient that you understand what their pain points are and that you\u2019ve worked with other customers who had the same set of problems or needs. You may be able to draw these conclusions by analyzing the details your research provides. For example, from the information available about a company\u2019s technology stack or a contact\u2019s vertical or role at an organization.\nIn some ways, the references you make are related to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and the problems that they need to solve. These companies are the ones who have benefited most from your product. If you need a refresher about what an ICP is and how to assemble it, check out this infographic:\nBack to Top\nDescribe The Reward\nThis is your opportunity to further entice your email recipient and build credibility with them. Is there a resource that you can share with them from your company\u2019s blog that gets to the heart of their pain points? Even better, are there any thought leadership materials that you created yourself that you can link to? Anything you can provide that indicates you are a worthwhile connection and that your organization is a trusted leader can help you to initiate that all-important first meeting.\nForget the Attachments\nRemember to link to any resources you provide\u2014attachments in first-contact emails can trigger SPAM blocking. For more information about avoid SPAM filters, check out the \u201cAvoid SPAM Filters\u201d article.\nBack to Top\nFormulate Your Request\nA well-formed call-to-action is a great way to close out your email. Without this, a recipient has no idea what you want from them or why you\u2019ve contacted them in the first place. Even if you\u2019ve crafted an email that is well-researched with amazing references and a great reward, the conversation stops here without a Request. Keep in mind what we mentioned earlier\u2014you aren\u2019t going to close a sale through email. Your request should be focused on setting up a call or meeting with the recipient.\nBack to Top\nPut It All Together\nRemember, the goal of using the RRRR Method in outreach campaigns is to create a formula for crafting relevant and personalized email messages at scale. The people you are reaching out to are just as busy as you are\u2014they don\u2019t have time and won\u2019t read something that doesn\u2019t immediately grab their attention or apply to them.\nSubject lines are vitally important to grab a potential customer\u2019s attention right away. In fact, 35% of email recipients open an email based on the subject line alone and 69% of email recipients report email as spam based solely on the subject line. In the example below, we\u2019ve used 3 of the 4 components to create our subject line, Research, Reference, and Request.\nThis subject matter makes a clear reference to the content of the email\u2014\u201cSalesforce\/Adoption issues.\u201d It also includes a strong call-to-action for the recipient\u2014\u201dTalk on Friday?\u201d If the person who receives this email is a Salesforce user who has had difficulty adopting the platform at their organization, this should at least pique their interest enough to get them to open the email.\nKeep it Tight. Keep it Focused.\nThis tried and tested tactic only works if you stay true to the company segments you have built out in your Product Market Fit Canvas. The Reference in your subject line absolutely should match the painpoints for the specific contacts who open it. In the case of our example above, we may have a killer subject line, but if we send a message with the same subject line to non-Salesforce users, we\u2019re fighting a losing battle.\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at how to craft the body of the message. The image below shows a breakdown of how each component should inform the contents of your email.\nHere\u2019s how we applied each of those recommendations to the body copy of our own email message:\nLet\u2019s analyze each individual component. We address the recipient by name; Jennifer. You can easily accomplish this at scale in Apollo with Basic Snippets. Then, we transition to the Research portion of the body copy.\nYour Linkedin profile shows that you led the Salesforce Implementation at Acme.\nHere, we\u2019ve established that we know who we are talking to and what function or responsibilities they hold at their company.\nNext, we move on to the Reference portion of the body copy:\nYour peer at ______ experienced the exact same challenge. I wanted to share a link that shows how he \nsolved the Salesforce Integration that resulted in increased adoption and made their reps \nmore productive.\nIn this part of the body copy, we have likened the pain points experienced by the recipient to a company that they might be familiar with. Additionally, we\u2019ve provided some details around how they addressed these pain points and turned them into a positive. This helps to create rapport with our recipients and demonstrates that they aren\u2019t the only person or business.\nFinally, we move on to the Request portion of the body copy:\nJennifer, is this relevant for you?\nHere, our call-to-action comes in the form of a question. We\u2019ve asked something specifically of our recipient in the hope that she will respond. In this instance, an affirmative answer is just as valuable as a negative one. This is because it allows us to continue the conversation, either specifically with Jennifer or we can follow up again to ask if there is someone else that we should talk to instead. If Jennifer does respond after a few follow-up emails, we may want to shift our focus to someone else in the organization if this account is a strong match for our Product Market Fit Canvas.\nBack to Top\nUse Apollo To Create An Outreach Campaign and Follow Up With Your Prospects\nRemember, an outreach campaign requires multiple touches and interactions. In an average outreach campaign, we would recommend you follow up with someone between at least 2 and 5 times. The email that we dissected in the section above is an example of an introductory email, but you may need to send follow-up emails, schedule calls, and participate in other tasks before you can close a deal.\nApollo Sequences allow you to create outreach campaigns at scale. In the Build an Outbound Sales Process: Target Real Buyers article, we found real people to reach out to and saved them to a list. We can use that list along with the email messaging we worked on in this article to create an Apollo sequence.\nA typical outreach campaign may take many different forms. Below, we have outlined 3 potential options for you to consider when you structure your campaign\/sequence. Each of these consists of 2-4 email steps.\nOption A\nThis option starts with a well-crafted introductory email. It also includes 3 additional emails with a \u201cJust following up\u201d email message.\nThese types of email campaigns are relatively low touch and may not result in as much success.\nOption B\nThis option is a bit more time-consuming as it requires you to follow up with more contact-specific information. You\u2019ll start your outreach with a well-crafted introductory email, but each subsequent follow-up should utilize new talking points, different problems, solutions, value propositions, impacts, and proof points. The table below shows an example of what this might look like:\nGeneral (A.1.1) Email 2 (A.1.2) Email 3 (A.1.3) Email 4 (A.1.4) \nWho: Company YC Startups in Current Batch\tYC Startups in Current Batch\tYC Startups in Current Batch\tYC Startups in Current Batch\t\nWho: Titles Founders\tFounders\tFounders\tFounders\t\nProblem Generate as much revenue as possible before Demo day\tHArd to find leads at scale for outbounding\tHArd to set up outbound systems from scratch\tAccess to good databases are expensive, sometimes more than $20,000 per year\t\nSolution All in one outbound sales platform for generating opportunities with 200 million contacts and an email engine\t200 million contact database with emails\tAll-in-one system cthat combines data with email automation best practices\tTurnkey soltuion with unlimited leads for a small flat rate fee\t\nValue Prop Build best-practice outbound engine in minutes\tSet more meetings by 5x the number of people you can reach out to\tSave time and get better results\tSave money\t\nOption C\nThis technique is a hybrid approach of Options A and B and is the most extensive of all 3 options. Apollo generally recommends using Option C. An example might look like this:\nValue Prop 1 (new thread)\n\"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\nValue Prop 2 (new thread)\n\"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\nValue Prop 3 (new thread)\n\"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\nIn this instance, the initial email follows a similar structure to Option A and B and lays out your initial value proposition. The second email in the campaign is a reply to the initial email and follows the \u201cJust following up\u201d email structure. The third email starts a brand new thread and lays out a new set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Email 4 is a follow-up to the third email thread. Email 5 starts a brand new thread and provides yet another set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Finally, email 6 concludes with a \u201cJust following up\u201d response to email 5. If at this point, the contact still has not engaged with you, they likely aren\u2019t going to. Our own testing at Apollo has shown that these follow-up emails can be vital to your success. They may even lead you to book 4 times the amount of meetings you might otherwise book.\nBack to Top\nPractical Exercise\nFinish filling out your Product Market Fit Canvas with the relevant details for Problem, Solution, Value Prop, Impact\/Benefit, and Proof Points. You can use a combination of information from your ICP research as well as the information in your company\u2019s business plan to fill it out. This will give you a leg up when you begin to perform individualized research for your potential contacts. If you get stuck, revisit the Do Your Research! section for a quick refresher.\nOnce you\u2019ve completed that research, create contact and account custom fields to store it in Apollo.\nBack to Top\nNext Steps\nOnce you\u2019ve finished filling out your Product Market Fit Canvas and you\u2019ve built and deployed an Outbound Sales Process of your own, you should stay focused on your goal metrics and continuously revise and iterate on your process. Head over to the \"Build an Outbound Sales Process: Analytics\" article to get started.\nBack to Top"}

Each section is described in detail below.\nRecords Enriched\nThe Records Enriched section displays the total number of CSV records submitted to Apollo in a pie graph. This graph is segmented by \"Matched Records,\" \"Duplicate Records,\" and \"Not Found.\"\nMatched Records: The number of CSV records that Apollo could match to the database\nDuplicate Records: The number of duplicate records in the CSV\nNot Found: The number of CSV records that Apollo could not match to the database\nHover your mouse over an individual segment to see the number of records for that segment.\nBack to Top\nCompleteness Score\nThe Completeness Score section of the CSV Enrichment Report provides a \"before and after\" snapshot of your CSV data based on the number of individual data points found in the CSV before and after enrichment. Within the bar chart, the \"Before\" bar shows the percentage of available fields that were completed within the CSV prior to enrichment. The \"After\" bar shows the percentage of fields completed after Apollo enriched the CSV.\nBack to Top\nEnrichment Result\nThe Enrichment Result section provides you with a bar chart view of the data. The left bar (\"Total Fields Enriched\") reflects the number of enriched columns over the total number of columns in the CSV. The right bar (Total Data Points) reflects the total number of enriched data points over the total number of possible data points.\nBack to Top\nMatched Fields\nThe Matched Fields section provides you with an overview of the fields that you mapped during the upload process. The first bar provides you with the number of fields that you mapped during this process. The second bar provides you with the total number of mapped CSV fields that Apollo was able to match values from. The third bar provides you with the total number of mapped CSV fields that Apollo could not match values from.\nWhy do I have \"Unmatched Fields?\"\nTypically, \"Unmatched Fields\" result from fields mapped incorrectly during the upload process. For example, if you mapped your CSV's \"Title\" column to Apollo's \"First Name\" field, Apollo would not be able to match any values for it.\nBack to Top\nEmails Enriched\nThe Emails Enriched section provides you with the total number of records (rows) in your CSV. It is displayed as a pie graph and is segmented by rows enriched with \"Verified\" email addresses, rows enriched with \"Not Verified\" email addresses, and rows where an email address was \"Not Found.\"\nVerified: The total number of verified emails that Apollo matched to the records in the CSV\nNot Verified: The total number of unverified emails that Apollo matched to the records in the CSV\nNot found: The total number of records for which Apollo could not find an email\nHover your mouse over an individual segment to see the number of records for that segment.\nBack to Top\nPhone Numbers Enriched\nThe Phone Numbers Enriched section provides you with two fields.

If you try to map the same Apollo stage to multiple HubSpot fields or the same HubSpot status to multiple Apollo fields, stage mapping between HubSpot and Apollo may not function accurately.\nIf you ever need to change the name of a HubSpot status after you\u2019ve mapped it in Apollo, or if you add a new status entirely, it\u2019s important to make sure you reflect those changes in Apollo and update your mappings. This way, Apollo can continue to map 1:1 with all of your HubSpot statuses. Similarly, any time you delete a status in HubSpot, you must delete the Apollo stage to which you mapped it and move the contact\/accounts associated with that stage to an active one. You must also map this stage to a status in HubSpot.\nHave additional HubSpot-related questions? Visit the HubSpot section of the Apollo Knowledge Base for more info!

However, as providers like Google bundle all access as a single group of permissions, Apollo cannot request individual permissions for the specific privileges it needs to ensure Apollo features function correctly.\nIt is important to understand that when you link your email or calendar, Apollo may use automated algorithms to extract certain personal information from your email and calendar content and related metadata, which may be added to Apollo's contributory data network. However, this data is never tied to a specific customer. Apollo only adds a piece of data to its database if multiple separate users and accounts have the same verified information for that contact, account, or industry.\nWhen you give Apollo the necessary access and permissions, Apollo can help you to:\nMailbox: Automate emails, create templates and follow-ups, view open rates, and more.\nGoogle Calendar: Empower contacts to book meetings with you through the Apollo meetings scheduler, attribute success to your booked meetings, view job changes, and more.\nFor more information about data sharing with Apollo, please refer to this article.\nNeed a Helping Hand?\nGot this far but couldn't find the answer you're looking for?

When you sync your calendar with Apollo, you can manage your availability for meetings, create different types of meetings, and view your scheduled meetings.\nThere are several advantages of leveraging meetings in your sales workflow, including:\nStreamline the Scheduling Workflow: Sync your calendar, configure your default meeting settings, and set your availability for each type of meeting to automate the scheduling process.\nEncourage Proactive Engagement: Make it easy for your prospects to reach you first so you can spend more time engaging in meaningful conversations and less time on administrative tasks.\nFacilitate Ease of Attendance: Eliminate friction between third-party platforms and reduce the risk of no-shows with automated meeting reminders.\nRefer to the following sections for an overview of the different Meetings features available.\nBack to Top\nMeeting Types\nMeeting types are the different meetings that you want to host. This is useful if you want to encourage different types of contacts to schedule different types of meetings with you. Example meeting types could include scoping calls, demos, brainstorming sessions, and partnership meetings.\nLeverage meeting types to remain in control of your schedule and provide your prospects with more context about the type of meetings they can book with you.\nUp to Your Eyeballs in Meetings?\nTrying to keep on top of all those many meetings? You can create numerous meeting types to help you clearly define the types of meetings participants can schedule with you. If you are on a free plan, you can activate up to 6 meeting types at a time. \nHowever, if you are on a paid plan, the world is your oyster! You can create and activate as many meeting types as you need.\nThere are 3 different types of meetings that you can create:\nSingle-host: This meeting type only ever has one host. Single-host meetings should be used for one-on-one discussions with your prospect.\nMulti-host: This meeting type has multiple hosts that co-host the meeting. When a prospect schedules a meeting of this type, all hosts must be available at the same time for the calendar slot to be available.\nRound robin host: This meeting type rotates between different hosts each time it is used to schedule a meeting. Round-robin meetings should also be used for one-on-one discussions. You can choose to rotate hosts based on either the availability of hosts for certain time slots or the equal distribution of hosts so that each host is booked as part of a rotation one by one.\nWhen you create a Meeting Type, you can specify the duration of the call, provide the appropriate meeting links, add a description, and set your availability.\nLet's Get Those Meetings Started!\nFor more information about how to manage, edit, and personalize your meeting types, follow the steps in the Manage Your Meetings in Apollo article.\nBack to Top\nScheduled Meetings\nGo to the Scheduled Meetings tab to view your upcoming meetings and keep track of the meetings that you previously attended. Meetings include details about the participants, the scheduled time for the meeting, and the meeting's duration.\nBack to Top\nInbound Routers and Web Form Integration\nInbound routers enable Apollo admins to automate the flow of scheduled meetings to different meeting types based on several factors, including contact names, emails, company sizes, and more. By setting up the appropriate logic for your inbound routers, you can ensure that specific prospects can easily schedule meeting with the right teams or sales reps.\nOnly Apollo admins can create inbound routers. Other users can be assigned meetings via inbound routers and view them, but cannot create them.\nIn addition to inbound routers, you can also integrate your own web forms with Apollo. With this option, prospects enter information into the web forms that you build on your own websites, and then schedule meetings with your team as they would with the inbound router workflow.\nApollo provides a JavaScript snippet that connects your web form to Apollo meetings. You will need a resource knowledgeable in front-end web engineering to help build the integration on your website.\nBack to Top\nSettings\nTo update your meeting settings, go to the Settings tab. From here, you can view your connected calendar, personalize your meeting link, edit your video conference link, adjust your default availability, and set your minimum schedule notice to avoid participants from booking you up at the last minute.\nBack to Top\nAdmin Console\nIf you are an Apollo admin, the Admin console tab enables you to view and edit all of the meeting types, inbound routers, and intake forms that you have created for your organization from a single location.\nBack to Top\nMeetings in Gmail\nIf you install the Apollo Chrome Extension, you can use meeting functionality directly in Gmail. The Meetings tab in the Chrome extension enables you to:\nProvide a link in your email for one of your single-host meetings. The guest can book any time you have availability based on the chosen meeting's settings.\nSet aside specific times for a meeting. The guest can only book the times you make available, and in the meantime, you can make sure those times are not scheduled for any other purpose.\nBack to Top\nFAQ: Help Prospects Add Meeting Invites to Their Calendars\nEmail providers, including Google and Microsoft, might prevent meeting invites from being automatically added to prospects' calendar. For example, Google provides users the ability to control whether invites are automatically added to Calendar based on whether they have previously interacted with an email address. If a prospect books a meeting with you and never receives the meeting invitation, these settings could be causing the problem.\nIf a prospect does not receive a meeting invitation, first tell them to check the spam folder of their mailbox.\nFor Google mailboxes, advise them to click the I know the sender option in the email if they find the invitation. This adds the sender to Google Calendar's safe sender list, which means future invites from the same email address will be automatically added to the prospect's calendar.\nIf a prospect prefers to automatically add meeting invites from all senders to their calendar, advise them to change the Add invitations to my calendar setting in Google Calendar to From everyone. Provide Google's Manage invitations in Calendar support article to help them change the setting.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"What Are Credits? \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Watch the Video\nOverview\nCredit is the currency that Apollo uses to retrieve contact data within the Apollo platform. When you request contact data, Apollo charges you credits for the verified information it finds.\nWhat About Accounts?\nPlease note, Apollo does not charge any credits for accounts. This means that you can save and export up to 300,000 accounts in your Apollo instance without paying a penny.\nApollo provides you with a monthly allowance of credits based on the terms of your billing cycle and the type of Apollo plan that you are on.

{"Topic":"Use an A\/B Test in a Sequence \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nA\/B tests allow you to create multiple versions of an email template in a sequence step to determine which message resonates more with prospects. With more than one email per sequence step, you can tweak messaging and refine communication over time to book more meetings and close more deals.\nEmail Enlightenment\nDid you know? The more A\/B tests a sequence has, the better for your sender reputation and deliverability score. Varied messages tend to indicate authenticity instead of spam. So while A\/B tests can help you fine-tune your messaging to resonate with each persona, they can also improve your sender score. For more deliverability tips, check out our email deliverability checklist.\nCheck out the following sections to use A\/B tests in a sequence.\nBack to Top\nUse an A\/B Test in a Sequence\nFirst, create a sequence or use an existing sequence. Then, add an A\/B test:\nLaunch Apollo and click Sequences. Select a sequence.\nAdd an automatic or manual email step, then click Add A\/B Test on the step you want to test.\nWatch Your Step\nYou can only A\/B test email steps.

Click the email.\nEdit the email template or use the AI assistant to generate content. When finished, click Save.\nTo B or Not To B\nTo effectively identify what is and isn't working at speed and scale, begin by A\/B testing wildly different email templates. Then iterate on the templates of the best-performing messages by A\/B testing more specific variables like individual subject lines or body text. Learn more in our master class on building a world-class outbound program.\nAfter editing your message, toggle the emails on.\nApollo evenly distributes each message variant in the A\/B test to different contacts in the sequence step.\nRepeat this process for additional emails and sequence steps. Then, observe the delivery data Apollo collects for each email. When you've collected enough data, you can determine the best-performing messages, and deactivate underperforming content.\nHow Much Data is Enough?\nRather than A\/B test an arbitrary number like 100 or 200 delivered messages, optimize by testing an amount that is statistically significant. Online calculators can help determine statistical significance. Then, only determine an A\/B test winner if you have a 90% or greater confidence interval. Learn more in lesson 5 of the Build a World Class Outbound Program Master Class.\nIn general, higher performing content will have higher delivery and interested rates, and lower spam blocked and opt out rates.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Overview \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"What is GDPR?\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a privacy regulation enacted by the European Union (EU) in April of 2016 to protect member country citizens and their right to privacy and control over their personal data in the digital world.\nThe internet and the way we use it have changed a lot since the first privacy laws were created in the 90s. It is the EU\u2019s hypothesis that allowing citizens more control over their digital footprint will foster more trust in online business. This should increase the citizens' likelihood of conducting business with them and thereby increase the digital economy.\nThe regulation went into effect on May 25, 2018, and the potential financial penalties for failure to comply are steep. The sections below provide a high-level overview of important terms, impacts, and how Apollo participates in GDPR.\nGDPR Legislation\nIf you would like to read the actual text for the General Data Protection Regulation in its most recent form, please visit EU GDPR website.\nBack to Top\nWhy is GDPR important?\nGDPR is important because it likely affects many people more than they realize. The safest assumption to make is that GDPR affects your company in at least some capacity, especially if you work for a company established in the EU, a company that sells to people within the EU, or a company that monitors the actions of citizens of the EU regardless of where your headquarters is or where you send marketing emails from.\nFailure to adhere to GDPR guidelines can be expensive. The highest amount a single company could pay is 4% of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher. Lower-tiered fines apply to lower-level penalties and can be the equivalent of 2% of global turnover or 10 million euros.\nBack to Top\nGDPR Terminology Glossary\nUse the glossary below to help make sense of the important terms contained in the GDPR.\nConsent: Contacts in the EU must provide explicit permission before you can contact them. If contact information was gained through a third party, the source must be specified at first contact with the Data Subject.\nCross-Border Data Transfer: Sending data and\/or personal information outside of EU\/EAA borders\nData Subject: A natural person and citizen of the EU whose information has been collected and can be identified by a data controller.\nData Controller: Controllers include parties who manage personal data or collect personal data. Apollo and Apollo's customers are considered data controllers.\nData Portability: A data subject\u2019s right to their own personal data from the data controller in a familiar, machine-readable format\nData Processor: A party that is instructed by the controller in how personal data should be handled and used. Apollo is also considered a data processor.\nData Subject Rights: New rights within the GDPR include the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and the right to object to profiling.\nGDPR Articles: The GDPR includes two sections\u2014the recitals and the Articles. The Articles include the text of the legislation and the Privacy Management Activities (PMAs) that are required for compliance.\nPersonal Data: Personal data included in Apollo typically includes name, company address, company phone number, email address, and IP address.\nPrivacy by Design and Default: Companies have an obligation to keep data privacy top-of-mind throughout the design process and to build default and adequate privacy controls into all new features. \nBack to Top\nGDPR's Effect On Sales Teams\nA key element of the GDPR that can cause business friction is the gravity of consent that is required from individuals. Specifically, in order to collect and handle (or to \u201cprocess\u201d) personal data of Europeans, marketers, and services like Apollo must have a \u201clegal basis.\u201d\nTwo common legal bases include:\nConsent of the data subject\nA \u201clegitimate interest\u201d to use the data that is not outweighed by fundamental \u201crights and freedoms,\u201d taking into account data subjects\u2019 \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of how data may be used \nThe GDPR cites \u201cdirect marketing\u201d as an example of a likely \u201clegitimate interest.\u201d\nMany legal commentators have noted that the GDPR leaves many questions unanswered and the potential for courts to resolve those questions in the years to come. Based on the best legal interpretations as of today, Apollo (and many others) believe that under this balancing test, most B2B marketing like newsletters and most direct marketing is protected as a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d if executed in a thoughtful way.\nOn the other hand, campaigns that are not targeted in a way that is likely to be useful to someone given their industry or position may not fit a \u201clegitimate interest.\u201d It will, therefore, be more important than ever for B2B marketers to use data wisely and tailor campaigns and marketing to be relevant.\nThese elements are also only relevant for prospects located in the EU so you don't need to worry about any of these regulations if you\u2019re emailing anyone outside the GDPR\u2019s jurisdiction.\nBack to Top\nHow does Apollo adhere to GDPR?\nThe Apollo team works hard to ensure that we remain in compliance for both the company's benefit as well as that of our customers. The Apollo platform is more complex in the way that it handles data than most, so our compliance is similarly complicated.\nOur Privacy Policy and Terms of Service include our Data Processing Addendum. The addendum helps users control what we do with their data and gives them the freedom to access and\/or remove their data from our system if they so desire, among other rights.\nMuch of maintaining GDPR compliance as a vendor involves how we secure our data. In order to maintain a high bar of security we have completed the following:\nApollo has achieved a SOC 2 and ISO 27001 security accreditation report. These accreditations evaluate Apollo controls that are relevant to data security, availability, and confidentiality. To gain them, Apollo needed to prove the success of our controls and their ability to maintain security, availability, and confidentiality over a predetermined span of time.\nApollo has implemented advanced data controls, which include the encryption of all user data, which is designed to protect our customers\u2019 data from leaks and malicious intent. The Apollo team regularly tests our product to fix any potential problems and maintains the industry\u2019s highest standards in information security.\nApollo has built and follows data incident response processes. These processes are tested each year for continued effectiveness.\nApollo built processes to supplement data recovery and integrity to help any customers whose data is lost or unintentionally corrupted.\nApollo has systems in place to protect all customers' rights to their own data footprint in the platform.\nApollo\u2019s key data sub-processors, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform, all have achieved similarly high-level security standards (SOC 2 and\/or ISO 27001 certifications, where possible) and have undergone rigorous security evaluations.\nGDPR lays out different requirements for \u201cProcessors\u201d and \u201cControllers\u201d of data. In Apollo's case, we operate as both a data controller and data processor since we help our users acquire data as a controller and communicate with prospects as a processor.\nBack to Top\nApollo's Adherence to GDPR as Data \u201cControllers\u201d\nAs it stands, Apollo is in compliance as a data controller by the standards contained in the GDPR. Apollo manages the data we collect to ensure it is in compliance. We also view it as our responsibility to educate everyone who uses our data to keep them informed and prepared to use our data in a way that similarly keeps them in compliance.\nOur users have the option of excluding citizens of member countries within the EU to help protect themselves against accidentally emailing someone they shouldn\u2019t. This prevents our customers from having to comb through lists of prospects to double-check their own compliance while prospecting.\nApollo customers that sell or market to EU citizens must be transparent in their intentions with any personal data that they collect and must have consent from individuals before sending them any information. If they do send any form of communication, they must also provide the ability for people to opt out of any future messages. If our customers also use Apollo as their sales engagement platform, they have the ability to include opt-out links within their emails.\nApollo has the ability to enrich data pertaining to citizens of the EU should our users already possess their contact information. For example, if a user has the email address and name of an individual working for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, we have the ability to enrich title and company information. With that said, this ability is only applicable if the enrichment is for the purpose of data hygiene and cleanliness or if you have a good faith reason to believe that the recipient has a demonstrated interest in receiving the information or offer, such as information that would help them perform their job.\nAs data controllers, Apollo maintains our own compliance and aids users with their own compliance, but Apollo highly recommends that all of our customers familiarize themselves with the regulations and seek out additional support from privacy advisors if any questions remain.\nBack to Top\nApollo's Adherence to GDPR as Data \u201cProcessors\u201d\nBeyond the precautions and measures laid out above, Apollo has completed and will undertake the following actions to maintain compliance as a data processor:\nWorking with our legal counsel (and when requested, those of our customers) to ensure full preparation and compliance.\nEvaluating every use case within our platform to help back up every decision we make should they face legal scrutiny.\nCrafting internal workflows to quickly and thoroughly complete data subject requests\nConducting an in-depth review of all requirements implications for data processors and where we may be a joint controller\nUpdating all contact information and notices so data subjects and customer data controllers may contact us if necessary\nObtaining all resources necessary for ongoing compliance requirements and documentation necessitated by GDPR\nUpdating and maintaining data security standards and workflows to meet all requirements necessitated by GDPR\nEvaluating all customer contracts where necessary to ensure we\u2019ve laid out a path for legal compliance for them to the best of our ability and to clearly detail our own responsibilities to avoid any possible confusion that could result in a penalty.\nWe are aware that laws and regulations could continue to change, so we will continue the work of maintaining compliance and will help our customers do the same.\nWhen in doubt, your best course of action is to talk to attorneys well-versed in the data-privacy space or with a data-specific officer.

{"Topic":"Create Custom Layouts for Your Searches \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nUse table layouts to customize the data you view when prospecting in Apollo. You can create private and public custom table layouts for your specific use cases and apply them to new and saved searches.\nWhether you manage a go-to-market team or are a solo selling machine, if you use the Apollo search tool, you can take advantage of customized table layouts.\nExample Use Case\nThe information you want to view in a search varies from use case to use case. Here are 2 examples that help demonstrate why you might want to customize your table layouts when prospecting:\nLet's say you are a sales rep. You create a saved search for contacts in North America actively searching with buying intent. You want to engage with net new contacts that have matched the criteria in your saved search in the last 24 hours. In this search, you might want to view the contact owner, the lead status, and the date they entered the pipeline.\nNow let's say you are a sales leader. You have asked your team to create a list of the contacts they will invite to an upcoming webinar. In this case, you might want your reps to view a table layout that includes contact status, SDR owner, account tier, and perhaps a custom field for subscription status.\nWhat If I'm Not an Admin?\nPlease note, you don't need admin access to create and apply custom layouts to your searches. However, only admin users can create public custom table layouts and access the \"table layouts\" tab in the settings. If you have a great idea for a new table layout for your entire team but don't have admin access, reach out to your team's admin users to make the magic happen.\nRefer to the sections below to create new custom layouts, manage your layouts in the settings, and apply a custom layout when prospecting.\nBack to Top\nCreate a New Custom Layout from the Search Page\nThere's More than One Right Way!\nPsst\u2014you can also create a new custom layout from the settings page.

{"Topic":"Troubleshoot the Apollo Dialer: Why Do I Have Connection or Audio Problems With the Dialer? \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nDo you have trouble hearing the person you're talking to on the Apollo dialer? Is your audio cutting out? Are you unable to make a call using the dialer?\nThere are several issues related to hardware, software, and network connectivity that can impact your ability to use the Apollo dialer successfully. But fear not! Apollo is here to help.\nThe following sections provide step-by-step guidance for troubleshooting your dialer issues:\nStep 1: Check Hardware\nStep 2: Perform Basic Troubleshooting\nStep 3: Troubleshoot Specific Audio Issues\nStep 4: Enable Call Debugging in Apollo\nStep 1: Check Hardware\nSoftware issues are often rooted in the hardware you use. Start by confirming that your hardware provides the resources that the dialer needs to function properly. Apollo recommends you use a computer with at least 16GB of RAM.\nApollo also recommends that you use a USB-based headset when making calls. The latency in a wireless headset can cause delays.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Perform Basic Troubleshooting\nWith your hardware confirmed to be performing adequately, you should perform some basic troubleshooting for your software, specifically your web browser and operating system settings.\nTroubleshoot Web Browser\nYour web browser can consume too much RAM or cause other issues that result in poor connection quality. Try the following steps to improve your dialer connection:\nConfirm that only 1 instance of Apollo is open in your web browser.\nClose browser tabs that you don't need open. Too many open tabs can result in heavy resource use on your computer.\nMake sure your browser is up to date. If you use Chrome, enter chrome:\/\/settings\/help in the address bar. This page displays whether Chrome is up-to-date or provides you with an option to update it. \nClear your browser cache. If you use Chrome, enter chrome:\/\/settings\/privacy in the address bar to view your browsing data. Then, click Clear Browsing Data.\nClick the Time range drop-down and select All Time. Then, click Clear data to clear the cache.\nPerform a hard refresh on your browser with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F5 for Windows PCs or Command+Shift+R for Macs. This clears the cache for a specific page.\nEven More Troubleshooting Options!\nTroubleshooting is not an exact science. Unfortunately, there are many ways in which your applications could stage a rebellion. Please read Troubleshoot the Apollo Chrome Extension for more tips on getting your applications back in your good graces.\nReview Windows Network Settings\nIf your issues with the dialer are not related to your web browser, you should review your Windows network settings to ensure that Windows is allowing the needed network connections.\nThe 2 network settings that are most likely to interfere with the Apollo dialer are:\nWindows firewall\nVPN\nWindows Firewall\nIf you have enabled your Windows firewall, it can interfere with the Apollo dialer. You can either disable the firewall entirely or whitelist Twilio's full IP and port ranges.\nTo disable your Windows firewall:\nOpen Control Panel, then click System and Security. \nClick Windows Defender Firewall. \nClick Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off. \nClick Turn off Windows Defender Firewall for both private and public network settings. \nWith your Windows firewall disabled, test your dialer connection again.\nWhitelist Twilio's IP Ranges \nIf you can't disable your Windows firewall, check your firewall configuration.\nYour firewall needs to give outgoing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) access to the public internet from the web browsers that use the dialer. The firewall also needs to allow return traffic in response.\nIf you are on a restricted network, you must whitelist Twilio's full IP and port ranges.\nGoing Through Changes\nTwilio\u2014the third-party provider Apollo uses to integrate voice calls\u2014is updating its IP and port ranges. If you've enabled your firewall, you need to keep the old IP and port ranges open in your infrastructure until January 23, 2024. You also need to add the following new IP and port ranges:\nAdd 168.86.128.0\/18 to your firewall rules.\nEnable UDP from these IP addresses over ports 10000-60000.\nOnce you\u2019ve updated your network infrastructure, you need to enable your account's production traffic to use the IP ranges.\nFor more information about Windows firewall, please refer to the Microsoft learning center.\nVPN Usage\nVPN usage might also affect which edge server Twilio uses to route traffic. This can add some latency to calls. For example, if you are in the US trying to make a call to the US without a VPN, Twilio uses an edge location in the US to route the call. However, if you use a VPN that connects you to a server in Australia for the same call, Twilio might route the call differently and negatively impact the call quality.\nIf you use a VPN, there are 2 options:\nApollo recommends you disconnect from your VPN when making calls.\nIf you cannot disconnect from your VPN, you need to coordinate with your engineering or IT team to allow Apollo permanent access via firewall and VPN rules.\nYou should also confirm that your antivirus software is not blocking Apollo and the dialer.\nBack to Top\nStep 3: Troubleshoot Specific Audio Issues\nIf you still have audio issues after checking your hardware, web browser, and network settings, you should troubleshoot based on the specific audio issue you are experiencing.\nThe following sections provide steps to take based on the specific nature of your audio problem.\nBack to Top\nAudio Cuts Out\nIf audio drops intermittently so that you have dead air, you are likely experiencing an unstable network connection. The dialer requires a high-speed, low-latency network connection.\nFirst, perform a speed test to verify your network connection speed. If your connection speed does not match what you pay for, talk to your internet service provider.\nIf your connection is on the slower side, follow these steps to improve your odds of a good dialer connection:\nWhen possible, use an ethernet cable for your internet connection rather than a WiFi connection. Wired connections are more reliable.\nClose tabs in your web browser. Tabs take up bandwidth.\nExit any other programs that use bandwidth.\nBack to Top\nUnclear Audio\nIf you maintain a steady connection when using the dialer, but you experience a garbled or otherwise unclear audio connection, there are several potential issues to explore.\nFollow these steps to try to eliminate your poor audio experience:\nUse a wired headset instead of your built-in computer microphone. As with the internet connection itself, a wired connection will deliver a more reliable audio experience.\nReduce ambient noise, such as nearby speakers or fans.\nTo avoid audio clipping (a form of audio distortion), make sure your microphone isn't too close to your mouth.\nAdjust the microphone levels in your computer settings. Your input may be too loud.\nEnsure that your computer has sufficient memory to process the dialer. Apollo recommends that your computer have at least 16GB of RAM.\nClose any applications that you don't need during calls.\nAntivirus software can be resource-heavy. Try disabling your antivirus program while you make a call.\nStay Safe Out There!\nApollo does not recommend disabling your antivirus software unless it is a last resort to troubleshoot an issue. Keep your network and computers safe at all times.\nBack to Top\nNo Audio\nConfirm that both your hardware and software meet all of the dialer's requirements. If you check and there is still no audio when using the dialer, Apollo recommends the following steps:\nIf you use an external headset, confirm you have attached your headset correctly.\nIf you are using a wired headset, try plugging your headset into a different port. Ports can fail without any warning.\nConfirm you have selected the right device in your sound settings. For example, your computer's audio output might be set to your computer speakers, even when your external headset is connected to the computer.\nTry connecting a different external headset.\nThe Apollo dialer integrates with Twilio. Run this Twilio-provided test to help pinpoint your issue. \nTry a different web browser. If you use Chrome, try the dialer with Microsoft Edge or Firefox. \nChrome Plated\nYou can try a different browser to see if the behavior differs, but Apollo recommends you stick with Chrome so that you can take advantage of the Apollo Chrome extension.\nConfirm you have given your web browser permission to play sound. \nIf you are using Chrome, go to chrome:\/\/settings\/content\/sound and make sure you have enabled the Sites can play sound radio button. If you have customized which sites can and cannot play sound from your browser, verify that your computer has https:\/\/www.apollo.io:443 listed in the Allowed to play sound section. \nConfirm you have given your web browser permission to use your microphone. \nIf you are using Chrome, go to chrome:\/\/settings\/content\/microphone. Verify that your computer has https:\/\/www.apollo.io:443 listed in the Allowed to use your microphone section. \nIf https:\/\/www.apollo.io:443 is listed under the Not allowed to use your microphone section:\nClick the Trash Can icon to delete it from the list. \nGo to chrome:\/\/settings\/content\/microphone. Then, click Sites can ask to use your microphone under the Default behavior section. \nFollow the instructions in Make and Receive VoIP Calls. When you try to place a call, Chrome will ask permission to use your microphone. Click Allow. \nBack to Top\nNo Ring Tone; One-way Audio\nIf you do not hear a ringtone when using the dialer to make a call, or only one side of the call can hear audio, this is likely due to high post-dial delay (PDD). This means Twilio sent a connection request to the telecom operator, but it\u2019s taking a lot to respond.\nPDD is most likely caused by the caller and receiver being geographically far away from each other. This means it takes time to establish a connection between the 2 parties. Using a VPN can add to the delay when establishing the connection. If you use a VPN, there are 2 options:\nApollo recommends you disconnect from your VPN when making calls.\nIf you cannot disconnect from your VPN, you need to coordinate with your engineering or IT team to allow Apollo permanent access via firewall and VPN rules.\nBack to Top\nRing Tone, but No Audio\nIf you hear a ring tone but no audio after the call is answered, the issue is most likely due to the telecom operator. Apollo recommends trying to make the call again later.\nBack to Top\nStep 4: Enable Call Debugging in Apollo\nIf the troubleshooting guidance in this article does not fix your issues, enable call debugging in Apollo and then contact the Apollo Support team. Refer to \"Configure the Dialer\" to learn how to enable call debugging.\nBack to Top"}
{"Topic":"Link Custom Salesforce Fields to Custom Apollo Fields \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nWhile Salesforce provides many out-of-the-box fields that you can use to sync your data back and forth between Apollo, there may be data that is important to your business that you can't track with traditional metrics. For this reason, Salesforce and Apollo allow you to create custom fields to store that data.\nIn order to leverage bi-directional sync between Apollo and Salesforce, you must first create a custom field in Salesforce and then link that field to a custom field in Apollo.\nCustom Fields in Salesforce\nPlease note, you need to create custom fields in Salesforce for each object type (Contacts, Leads, Accounts, or Opportunities) before you can link them to to the corresponding object and field type in Apollo.\nRefer to the sections below for detailed instructions about each part of the process.\nBack to Top\nCreate a Custom Salesforce Field\nSalesforce Development\nPlease note, Salesforce provides a software suite that is under constant active development.

{"Topic":"Create and Assign Permission Profiles \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nMany different types of users on your team can use Apollo. Every user might have different responsibilities for their roles, which means it is important to utilize the principle of least privilege.\nPermission profiles enables admins to implement access control in Apollo. By creating and assigning permission profiles, you can ensure that no users can access or alter parts of Apollo that are not relevant to their roles.\nDefault Permission Set\nApollo uses Admin as the default permission profile. You cannot modify most of the Admin permission profile settings.\nThe following sections detail how to create and assign permission profiles.\nBack to Top\nCreate a New Permission Profile\nTo create a new permission profile:\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings > Permission Profiles.\nClick New Profile. \nEnter a name for the new permission profile, then click Create. \nEnable or disable feature-level permissions in Apollo by toggling the feature sliders on or off. \n(Optional) To view and apply specific permissions, open the drop-down for each feature. Then, add permission that you want to enable for the profile and determine which users can be impacted. \nKeep It on the Q.T.\nApply the Email visibility setting in the Emails section with caution. If you select can see all emails from other users, all Apollo users within your organization have access to view every other user's email activity. This includes all the emails that Apollo imports from each user's connected mailbox, whether a user sends them through Apollo or not. \nIf you have a large team and are concerned about email confidentiality, Apollo recommends that you select the following checkbox instead: can see outbound emails sent within the Apollo platform and replies to those emails, but not other emails. This means that users can only see the emails sent and replied to through Apollo. They do not see any other emails from your users' connected mailboxes.

{"Topic":"Use Advanced Dynamic Variables \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nDynamic variables enable you to personalize emails for individual contacts by leveraging Apollo's data and, in the case of custom dynamic variables, your own data research. Advanced dynamic variables are somewhat different from basic dynamic variables in that they allow for limited conditional logic.\nThis means advanced dynamic variables can provide a fallback if there's no data for a specific field for a contact. Conditional logic helps emails with variables send successfully, instead of failing if Apollo doesn't have the necessary data to fill the variable for a contact.\nThe following sections show how to use all of the different types of advanced dynamic variables supported in email templates.\nBack to Top\nTypes of Advanced Dynamic Variables\nAdvanced dynamic variables come in several different flavors:\nEmpty Fallback\nDynamic Fallback\nLetter Case and Pluralization Operators\nNow-date\/Time Operators\nCustom Date Operators\nEach of these advanced dynamic variable types enables you to further personalize email templates for your customers.\nBack to Top\nEmpty Fallback\nUse the empty fallback advanced dynamic variable to send emails without fearing they won't send because a basic dynamic variable lacks data. With an empty fallback, your email sends with a blank space in place of the variable if Apollo doesn't have data for a contact.\nImagine you want to send an email that greets each recipient by their first name. You could use the {{first_name}} basic dynamic variable to say:\nGreetings {{first_name}},\nHowever, if Apollo doesn't have a first name for a contact in your sequence, the dynamic variable fails and Apollo moves your email to the Not Sent folder.\nTo avoid this situation, use the advanced dynamic variable {{#if first_name}}{{#endif}} to create a generic fallback:\nGreetings {{#if first_name}}{{#endif}},\nIf Apollo has the data for an email recipient, the dynamic variable renders in the email:\nGreetings John,\nIf Apollo doesn't have the data, the email still sends with an empty space in place of the dynamic variable:\nGreetings ,\nBack to Top\nDynamic Fallback\nAdvanced dynamic variables with a dynamic fallback go a step further than the empty fallback variety. These dynamic variables insert text that you define in the event that there is no relevant data for a contact.\nImagine you want to use generic text if a recipient's first name is unavailable. To do that, use the following advanced dynamic variable to create a dynamic fallback:\nHi {{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}},\nIf Apollo has the data for an email recipient, the first name renders in the email:\nHi John,\nIf Apollo doesn't have the necessary data, the email renders with there in place of the variable:\nHi there,\nIt's important to understand what each part of the dynamic variable does. The first part, {{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}, is the start of the conditional logic. It tells Apollo \"If there is a value for first name, render that first_name value in the opened email\". This is similar to the basic dynamic variable {{first_name}}, with the inclusion of an {{#if}} statement.\nThe next part,{{#else}}there, tells Apollo \"If no first name value is available for this contact, use the text there instead\".\nThe final part, {{#endif}}, tells Apollo that this is the end of the conditional logic for this dynamic variable.\nBack to Top\nLetter Case and Pluralization Operators\nAdvanced dynamic variables with letter case and pluralization operators take the value of a field and change the case or the pluralization.\nString Fields Only\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on string field types. They don't work for other field types.\nThe following examples show how letter case and pluralization operators can be used:\nDynamic Variables Description Example \n{{title->lowercase}}\tTakes the value of a contact's job title and converts every letter in it to lowercase.\tEngineering Manager becomes engineering manager \t\n{{title->capitalize_each_word}}\tTakes the value of a contact's job title and converts the first letter in every word to uppercase.\tengineering manager becomes Engineering Manager \t\n{{title->plural}}\tTakes the value of a contact's job title and converts it to the plural form.\tEngineering Manager becomes Engineering Managers \t\nAdd a -> within the variable to combine multiple case and pluralization operators. For example, to convert a contact's job title to uppercase and plural form, combine the operators within the same variable:\n{{title->capitalize_each_word->plural}}\nThis dynamic variable renders the job title engineering manager as Engineering Managers.\nBack to Top\nNow-Date\/Time Operators\nAdvanced dynamic variables with {{now_month}}, {{now_day}}, and {{now_time}} operators take the current date and manipulate it in various ways.\nDate-Type Fields Only\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on date field types. They don't work for other field types.\nThe following examples show how now-date and time operators can be used:\nDynamic Variables Description Example \n{{now_day->plus_X}}\tTakes the current day and moves it forward by the specified number of business days. If the number of business days exceeds the number of days in the current month, Apollo accounts for the transition and continues the count at the first day of the upcoming month. You can use any whole number (integer) here.\tIf today is the 15th day of the month and a Wednesday, the dynamic variable {{now_day->plus_5}} renders as 22 in the opened email.\t\n{{now_day->minus_X}}\tTakes the current day and moves it backward by the specified number of business days. If the number of business days exceeds the number of days in the current month, Apollo accounts for the transition and continues the count at the last day of the previous month. You can use any whole number (integer) here.\tIf today is the 15th day of the month and a Wednesday, the dynamic variable {{now_day->minus_5}} renders as 8 in the opened email.\t\n{{now_month->plus_X}}\tTakes the current month and moves it forward by the specified number of months. You can use any whole number (integer) between 1 and 11.\tIf the current month is April, the dynamic variable {{now_month->plus_1}} renders as May in the opened email.\t\n{{now_month->minus_X}}\tTakes the current month and moves it backward by the specified number of months. You can use any whole number (integer) between 1 and 11.\tIf the current month is April, the dynamic variable {{now_month->minus_2}} renders as February in the opened email.\t\n{{now_year->plus_X}}\tTakes the current year and moves it forward by the specified number of years. You can use any whole number (integer) here.\tIf the current year is 2024, the dynamic variable {{now_year->plus_2}} will render as 2026 in the opened email.\t\n{{now_year->minus_X}}\tTakes the current year and moves it backward by the specified number of years. You can use any whole number (integer) here.\tIf the current year is 2024, the dynamic variable {{now_year->minus_1}} will render as 2023 in the opened email.\t\n{{now_time_of_day}}\tDisplays the current time stage of the day (morning, afternoon, evening).\tIf the current time is 9:00am, the dynamic variable Good {{now_time_of_day}}, renders as Good morning, in the opened email.\t\nBack to Top\nCustom Date Operators\nSelect Plans Only\nCustom fields and dynamic variables that leverage custom date operators are only available for customers on certain Apollo plans. If you don't have access and would like to upgrade your plan, reach out to the Apollo sales team.\nAdvanced dynamic variables with custom date operators make use of custom fields configured for dates and manipulate them in various ways.\nDate-Type Fields Only\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on date-type field types. They don't work for other type fields.\nImagine you create a custom field called product_announcement for the date of your yearly product announcement that takes place on October 15, 2024. That custom field includes a month, day, and year, so you can use custom date operators in a dynamic variable to extract specific pieces.\nThe dynamic variable {{product_announcement->day}} renders as 15, the dynamic variable {{product_announcement->month}} renders as October, and the dynamic variable {{product_announcement->year}} renders as 2024 in the opened email.\nIn addition, you could use the dynamic variable {{product_announcement->weekday}} to extract the day of the week for your custom date. In this instance, it renders as Tuesday in the opened email because October 15, 2024 is a Tuesday.\nBack to Top\nExample Use Case For Advanced Dynamic Variables\nFormatting For Clarity Only\nIn this example, the text is formatted to offset the dynamic variables from the plain-text copy, and line breaks are inserted between each conditional logic statement for ease of reading. You should write dynamic variables in Apollo as a single, continuous line.\nFor additional context, take a look at a real-world example of how to use advanced dynamic variables in your email template. Within an automatic email task, we created an email template with body copy that leverages several different advanced dynamic variable types.\nHi {{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}},\nWe know many companies like\n{{#if industry == Marketing}}Company 1\n{{#else}}{{#if industry == Big Data}}Company 2\n{{#else}}Company 3{{#endif}}{{#endif}}\nare looking for new tools to implement for {{now_year->plus_1}}, and we'd like to walk you through our platform so that you have a good understanding of our full capabilities. Does {{now_weekday->plus_2}} or {{now_weekday->plus_3}} {{now_time_of_day}} work for you?\nUse Case Explanation: Nested Dynamic Variables Pointing to Specific Field Values\nThe {{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}} dynamic variable sets up a fallback for the first name to render as there if there is no first name data available for the email recipient.\nThe {{#if industry == Marketing}}Company 1 portion of the dynamic variable tells Apollo to render the text as Company 1 if the Industry field for the email recipient is Marketing. If the industry is not Marketing, Apollo moves on to the next piece of conditional logic.\nThe {{#else}}{{#if industry == Big Data}}Company 2 portion tells Apollo to render the text as Company 2 if the Industry field for the email recipient is Big Data. If the Industry is not Marketing or Big Data, Apollo moves on to the fallback portion of the conditional logic.\nThe dynamic variable {{#else}}Company 3 is the fallback if the email recipient's Industry field does not match Marketing or Big Data. In this instance, the text renders as Company 3 in the opened email.\nThe final portion of the dynamic variable, {{#endif}}{{#endif}}, closes the conditional logic. Two {{endif}} statements are required because there are nested {{#if}} statements.\nHow many {{endif}} statements do I need?\nAs a general rule, for each {{#if}} statement in your dynamic variable, you need a corresponding {{#endif}} to close the dynamic variable.\nUse Case Explanation: Now-Time Dynamic Variables\nThe dynamic variable {{now_year->plus_1}} tells Apollo to take the current year 2024 and add 1 year to it. When the recipient opens this email, this variable renders as 2025.\nThe dynamic variable {{now_weekday->plus_2}} tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance it by 2 days. If Apollo sends the email on a Monday, the text in the email renders as Wednesday. If Apollo sends this email on a Thursday, the text will render the dynamic variable as Monday because it is the next available weekday.\nThe {{now_weekday->plus_3}} dynamic variable tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance it by 3 days. If Apollo sends the email on a Tuesday, the text in the email will render as Friday. If Apollo sends the email on a Wednesday, the text renders as Monday. Apollo renders the dynamic variable as the next available business day if the day of the week specified by the dynamic variable falls on a weekend day.\nFinally, the {{now_time_of_day}} dynamic variable tells Apollo to display the current time stage of the day for the recipient based on their local time in their local timezone (when it is available) and renders morning, afternoon, or evening.\nBack to Top"}

Make sure you read this article to set up the integration correctly from the get-go.\nSalesforce\nIntegration\nConnect Apollo to Your Salesforce Account\nUnderstand Opportunity Stages and Salesforce\nCredentials\nSalesforce Credentials Overview\nConnect \"Team Sync\" Authentication Credentials To Your Salesforce Integration\nHubSpot\nIntegration\nConnect Apollo to Your HubSpot Account \nDon't Use a CRM?\nPlease note that if you do not use HubSpot or Salesforce in your day-to-day workflow, fear not! This is not a mandatory step. You can skip this and still access actionable insights from the data health center if you configure your personas and account segments and then import a CSV file.\nBack to Top\nMap Fields\nTo gain full functionality of the data health center, make sure that you map your stages and fields between Apollo and your CRM.\nClick Close in the Map fields modal that appears.\nIf you have already mapped default fields, custom fields, and stages for the contacts and accounts in your CRM, click Save & Continue.\nIf you have not mapped your fields yet, refer to the following documents for further guidance:\nSalesforce\nMap Default Apollo Fields to Salesforce\nLink Custom Salesforce Fields to Custom Apollo Fields\nAutomatically Create and Map Stages Between Salesforce and Apollo\nHubSpot\nConfigure HubSpot Data Mapping\nWhat If I Don't Use HubSpot or Salesforce?\nAlthough recommended, please note that this is not a mandatory step. If you do not use Salesforce or HubSpot, you can skip this step and still access actionable insights by configuring your personas and account segments well. Then, when you finish the setup process, you can upload a CSV file.\nBack to Top\nPersonas\nIf you want to compare the right data and narrow down your results to take action on the contacts that best match your ideal customer profile, you need to create personas. This allows you to check the health of the specific contacts most relevant to your company and business strategy.\nIf you have already created and activated your key personas in Apollo, click Save & continue to move to the next step.\nIf you have not created all your core personas in Apollo, click Create more personas, then apply and save the relevant filters for each of your target personas.\nWill the Real ICP Please Stand Up!\nPlease note that this is a very important step in the setup process. The more specific you are when you create your personas, the easier it is to narrow down the data sets that you want to focus on. When you create highly targeted personas, you can better visualize the health of your data in the dashboard and pinpoint the specific records that match your core ICP.\nFor more information about how to create personas in Apollo, refer to the following articles:\nCreate a Persona\nAccess, Edit, and Delete Personas\nBack to Top\nAccount Segments\nAccount segments are similar to personas but for accounts instead of contacts. They are sets of key account filters that you can apply to find and target the right types of companies faster. Account segments include filters like company location, number of employees, stage, revenue, buying intent, job postings, and much more.\nWhen you define the specific accounts that match your ideal customer profile, Apollo can narrow down the results in the data health center and show you the most relevant records for your company.\nClick Create more account segments to create and activate your core account segments in Apollo.\nGive your account segment a name to make it easier to identify later.\nThen, click the filter accordion next to the filters you want to apply to your account segment. Apollo displays the records on the right-hand side.\nNeed a Helping Hand?\nFor more information about account filters, refer to the Company Info Filters article.\nClick Save account segment when you have applied and saved the relevant filters for this target account segment.\nOnce you have created your core account segments, click View Dashboard to proceed to the data health center.\nNow that you've finished the initial setup process, you can leverage the insights from the data health center to access your total addressable market.\nBack to Top"}
{"Topic":"Create Inbound Routers for Your Meetings \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nInbound routers help you automate the process of scheduling meetings via Apollo and scale processes across teams and organizations. You can choose which meeting type your team's prospects can book based on their answers to your intake form. You can also redirect prospects to websites or present custom messages.\nAt an organization level, you as an Apollo admin can set up a single link that routes meetings across different teams or SDRs. This means prospects will always schedule meetings with the right people.\nAdmins Only!\nOnly Apollo admins can create inbound routers. Other users can be assigned meetings via inbound routers and view them, but cannot create them.\nCustomers on paid plans can create as many inbound routers as needed! If you are on a free plan, your organization's admins are limited to creating 3 inbound routers total across all admins.\nBack to Top\nStep 0: Before You Begin\nA key function of inbound routers is to route scheduled meetings to the appropriate teams or SDRs. Before setting up your inbound routers, create the meeting types that you want to use for this purpose.\nBack to Top\nStep 1: Create Your Intake Form Template\nFor the intake form, you decide which questions you ask your prospects when they schedule a meeting with you. Then, the answers determine the rules and actions that apply to them later in this process.\nEach form template can be reused across your inbound routers as well as round-robin meetings. If you want to ask different prospects the same set of questions, add the same form template to the applicable routers.\nProspects Become Accounts and Contacts\nWhen a prospect submits your intake form, Apollo checks whether they are already a contact or account. If not, Apollo creates a contact\/account with the information the prospect submitted.\nTo create your intake form template:\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings.\nClick Create, then Intake forms. \nEnter a name for your form template, then click Create. \nBy default, your intake form requires prospects to enter their name and email address. These fields cannot be removed from your form, but you can rename the question.\nTo add more fields to the form, click Add a question. Choose from standard options such as company size and phone number, or create a custom question with your own input types. When choosing routing options, responses to custom questions can be linked to custom fields you've created in Apollo.\nIf you choose Single-select or Multi-select as your input type for a custom question, you need to provide answers that the prospects can select. \n(Optional) If you add a custom question, there are 3 separate choices you can make.\nFirst, if a contact or account does not already exist, Apollo automatically creates them when prospects submit your intake form. Choose an option from the Apollo field drop-down to map responses to a custom contact field in Apollo. If you set up the Salesforce or HubSpot integrations and adjusted the push settings, Apollo might also push the response to the CRM field that you mapped to the Apollo field. \nNext, to make a question mandatory, toggle the Set as required option on. \nFinally, to hide the question from the prospect, toggle the Set as hidden slider on. Then, enter a URL query parameter and default field value to track meetings booked via this link. The URL query parameter serves as a UTM tracking component in the meeting link URL.\nThis option enables you to track important metrics related to how a meeting is booked. For example, if you are adding the meeting link to your company's Facebook page, you can set the URL query parameter to facebook to track the source. \nSalesforce Opportunities\nIf you're using the Salesforce integration, Apollo also creates deals when prospects complete the meeting booking process. Refer to Deals Overview to learn how you can push Apollo deals to Salesforce to create opportunities.\nClick Add to save the intake form question.\nWhen you have finished adding questions, click Save.\nRepeate these steps to create more form templates.\nTo edit or deactivate form templates, go to Meetings and click the Forms tab. You cannot change the status of a form template until it has been removed from any linked meeting types and inbound routers.\nBack to Top\nStep 2: Set Up a New Inbound Router\nTo set up an inbound router:\nLaunch Apollo and click Meetings.\nClick Create, then Inbound router setup. \nEnter a router name, then click Create. \nClick Select form to add the form template that you created in Step 1. \nClick the Choose Form drop-down and select the form template that you want to use for your inbound router. Then, click Save. \nBack to Top\nStep 3: Add Your Routing Options\nWith your intake form ready to collect prospects' answers, you can create rules and actions that determine which prospects Apollo filters to specific final destinations.\nTo set up rules and actions for your inbound router:\nGo to the rules and actions section of the inbound router. Here, you can choose from the following options:\n-If\/else rule: Create different Yes\/No paths, with each path ending in a different action. For more details, refer to the If\/else Rule section of this article.\n-Ownership rule: Create a Yes\/No based on whether a prospect is already assigned to account owners or contact owners within Apollo. For more details, refer to the Ownership Rule section of this article.\n-Book meeting: End the path with the prospect scheduling a meeting. Choose from existing meeting types or create a new meeting type just for this path.\n-Send to external url: Redirect prospects to a landing page or other website of your choice. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.\n-Display custom message: Present prospects with a message that you craft. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.\n-Default fallback: Present prospects with a standard message across your inbound router. Use this option to display the same custom message to end multiple paths. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.\nFor this walkthrough, Apollo shows you the simplest route\u2014ending a path with prospects booking a meeting based on an existing meeting type.\nClick Book meeting, then Link to existing meeting type. \nClick the Single-host meetings tab if you want to send meetings to an individual. Click the Shared meetings tab to route to meetings with round robin or multi-host formats. Then, find and select the specific meeting type you want to use to schedule meetings. \nReview the details of the meeting type. Then, click Add to router. \nReview your inbound router to ensure everything looks good. Then, click Publish to activate the router. \nBack to Top\nIf\/else Rule: Automate Your Meeting Routing\nWhen creating inbound routers, the if\/else rule is a powerful option that you can use to route prospects to different end actions based on their answers to the intake form questions.\nThe if\/else rule creates yes\/no paths, and you decide how each path ends based on whether a prospect's answers meet the criteria you set. For example, let's say you add the company size question to your intake form and you want to route prospects to different hosts based on their responses.\nTo do so:\nWhen you add rules and actions, click If\/else rule. \nClick the respond type drop-down and choose Company size. Select an option from the value drop-down and decide whether your rule will match that value. Then, click Save.\nFor this example, Apollo selected is and 5000+. This means the yes path is for respondents that chose 5000+ as the answer and the no path is for everyone else. \nTo finish each of your paths, select Add rule\/action. Choose from the routing options. If you want to create more yes\/no paths, add another if\/else rule. \nReview your inbound router to ensure everything looks good. Then, click Publish to activate the router.\nThe if\/else rule follows similar logic regardless of the input question. This means you can follow these steps to create inbound routers based on your needs. The following image shows what is possible when you add more paths.\nBack to Top\nOwnership Rule: Route Prospects to Account\/Contact Owners\nThe ownership rule enables you to route prospects to their existing account\/contact owners in Apollo. Use this option to create a single yes\/no path. The yes path always ends with the prospect scheduling a meeting with the appropriate account\/contact owner.\nWith the ownership rule, Apollo checks the email address that a prospect enters in your intake form to determine the routing. If the email address is owned by an account\/contact owner, the prospect follows the yes path and is able to book a meeting with that account\/contact owner.\nTo use the ownership rule:\nWhen you add rules and actions, click Ownership rule. \nChoose either Account Owner or Contact Owner. \n(Optional) By default, all of your account\/contact owners are added, which means prospects with a matching domain can book a meeting with them. If you don't want owners to be available via this path, toggle the slider off for them. \n(Optional) By default, Apollo sets the same standard meeting type for all account\/contact owners under the ownership rule's yes path. The location of the meeting type (Zoom or Google Meet) is determined by the individual user's settings.\nTo change the details of standard meeting type for all owners, select the pencil icon in the default meeting type section. To instead set meeting types individually, select an option from the Meeting drop-down for each owner. \nClick Save. This creates your yes path. All prospects that are identified as matching an eligible account\/contact owner will be able to schedule a meeting based on the options you selected.\nTo finish your no path, select Add rule\/action and choose from the routing options. If you want to create yes\/no paths based on responses to the intake form, add an if\/else rule.\nReview your inbound router to ensure everything looks good. Then, click Publish to activate the router.\nBack to Top\nEdit an Existing Inbound Router\nTo edit a published or in-progress inbound router, launch Apollo and click Meetings > Inbound routers. Click the inbound router, or click additional options (...) and then Edit.\nDepending on where in the inbound router you edit, click the pencil icon or the additional options (...) button and click Edit. Then, make your changes and either save or publish your inbound router again.\nYou have now edited an inbound router in Apollo Meetings.\nBack to Top\nDelete an Inbound Router\nTo edit a published or in-progress inbound router, launch Apollo and click Meetings > Inbound routers. Click additional options (...), then Delete.\nIn the warning pop-up, click Delete.\nYou have now deleted an inbound router in Apollo Meetings.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Follow Apollo's Recommended Default Field Mapping \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nWhen you integrate a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, Apollo lists the default contact and account fields you can map to the CRM. Fields that you do not map will not sync across Apollo and the CRM, so you should map all default fields to avoid data discrepancies.

{"Topic":"Add and Complete LinkedIn Tasks in a Sequence \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nSequences are outreach campaigns with any number of sequential contact points and tasks that you can customize to personally engage your target audiences at scale. There are several types of steps available in Apollo sequences, including the ability to complete tasks in LinkedIn.\nThe benefits of using LinkedIn steps in a sequence include:\nPersonalization at scale: Create templates for connection requests and InMail messages and personalize your approach with snippets and dynamic variables.\nStreamlined workflow: Access a contact's LinkedIn profile with one click and document key information with ease.\nImproved performance: Keep track of every task you execute and leave suggestions and prompts that can help you increase engagement.\nBe Accountable\nYou need a LinkedIn account to see any information about a contact. You can use a different email account for your Apollo account and LinkedIn account.\nClick here to create a new LinkedIn account. To learn more about how to prospect with LinkedIn, read the Prospect in LinkedIn article.\nThe following sections detail the LinkedIn tasks available to you in sequences and how to use them to track your LinkedIn prospecting efforts.\nBack to Top\nUnderstand the LinkedIn Tasks\nThere are 4 LinkedIn tasks you can use in your sequence. These steps create a task in Apollo that can be auto-executed from Tasks and the Apollo Chrome extension. The steps include:\nView Profile: View a contact's LinkedIn profile to gain specific information such as education history, job history, current company details, and colleagues. When executed, this step takes you to the LinkedIn's profile and marks the task as completed.\nInteract with Post: Interact with a contact's posts on LinkedIn. When executed, this step takes you to the activity section of a contact's LinkedIn profile and marks the task as completed. Then, you can manually interact with a contact's LinkedIn post.\nSend Connection Request: Connection requests allow you to direct message a contact and, in some cases, are necessary to see and interact with the contact's posts. When executed, this step automatically sends a connection request to a contact and, if it succeeds, marks the task as completed. You can send connection requests with or without a message.\nSend Message: When executed, this step sends a direct message to a contact and, if it succeeds, marks the task as complete. A contact must be a connection on LinkedIn before a message can be sent to them, so this should be the last step in developing a relationship with a contact through LinkedIn. You only want to message a contact if you are sure they would like to speak with you. Otherwise, it will feel like spam.\nWhen you choose to Send Connection Request or Send Message, you can create a template. You can also use snippets and dynamic variables to personalize outreach to your contacts. For more on snippets, refer to Create and Edit Snippets. For more on dynamic variables, refer to Use Basic Dynamic Variables.\nExecuting too many LinkedIn tasks at the same time can lead to your account being marked as a bot. LinkedIn temporarily restricts your account if you send too many invitations within a short amount of time, or if too many of your invitations have been ignored, left pending, or marked as spam by the recipients. Please be cautious and restrict the number of invites you send.\nTypes of Sequence Steps\nFor more information about the available step types in a sequence, please refer to the Available Steps in a Sequence section of Sequences Overview.\nBack to Top\nAdd LinkedIn Tasks to Existing Sequences\nShiny and New\nIf you prefer to add LinkedIn steps to a new sequence instead, refer to Create a Sequence.\nWhen you combine prospecting with LinkedIn and the ability to track tasks with sequences, you can reach your goals easier. You can track each step of your LinkedIn prospecting process by adding tasks to your existing sequences in Apollo. To do so:\nLaunch Apollo and click Sequences.\nClick the sequence that you want to update. \nClick Add a step. \nChoose the LinkedIn task that you want to add to your sequence. \nDefine the amount of time that Apollo should wait before triggering this step when the previous step is complete as well as the priority of the task. You can also add notes about the task. \nUse the advanced settings option if you want to automatically skip tasks after the due date. \nThen, click Complete. \nThe LinkedIn task is now added to your sequence. To rearrange the steps in your sequence, drag and drop a step to a different spot.\nBack to Top\nAdd Contacts to Your Sequence\nNow that you have your LinkedIn steps in your sequence, you should add contacts. The contacts you add will run through your LinkedIn sequence.\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to add contacts to a sequence, refer to Add Contacts to a Sequence.\nOne at a Time\nBe aware that a contact should only be in 1 sequence at a time.\nBack to Top\nExecute LinkedIn Tasks in Your Sequence\nWith a contact added to your sequence, you can use your LinkedIn tasks to guide yourself through engagement. You do need to be logged in to your LinkedIn Account to execute your LinkedIn tasks.\nTo execute LinkedIn tasks in your sequence:\nLaunch Apollo and click Sequences.\nConfirm your sequence is toggled on, then click your sequence to access it. \nConfirm the steps in your sequence are also enabled. \nGo to Tasks.\nClick the checkbox for each task that you want to execute, then click the Execute tasks icon. You will be taken to LinkedIn where the task will be automatically completed. If a contact does not have a LinkedIn profile, the task will not execute. \nYou have now executed the LinkedIn tasks in your sequence. A message from Apollo appears in LinkedIn to confirm the tasks have been completed.\nYou can repeat this process for each task until the LinkedIn sequence is complete.\nSkipping Stones\nYou are not beholden to any of the tasks you create. You can skip any task that you do not want to complete.\nBack to Top\nTroubleshoot LinkedIn Task Errors\nIf Apollo encounters a problem executing a task for a specific contact, you will see an error icon in the tasks queue pop-up next to the contact's name.\nThere are a few reasons why you might encounter an error when executing a LinkedIn task:\nYou have attempted to execute a send message task before the contact has accepted your LinkedIn request. Apollo can only send messages to contacts that are already part of your LinkedIn network.

{"Topic":"Automatically Create and Map Stages Between Salesforce and Apollo \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nWhile you can always manually map stages between Apollo and Salesforce, you can also use automapping to make the job easier. If an unmapped stage in Apollo matches an unmapped value in Salesforce, then Apollo automatically maps the two together. Additionally, for Salesforce values that don\u2019t have a matching stage in the platform, Apollo will create one for you.\nApollo will not overwrite any mappings you created before running the auto-mapping feature. Apollo will only automatically map stages that are not already mapped.\nRefer to the sections below to automatically map contact, lead, or account fields from Salesforce to stages in Apollo. Keep in mind that the process for automatically mapping stages is the same for all record types.\nBack to Top\nAutomatically Map Stages\nTo automatically map your Apollo stages to your Salesforce fields:\nLaunch Apollo and click the integrations icon. \nFeeling Left Out?\nOnly users with permission to edit the integrations settings can access the integrations page in Apollo. If you want to automatically map your stages, reach out to an admin to update your permissions. For more info on permission profiles, refer to this article.\nClick View in the Salesforce section. \nClick View in the Stage and Field Mappings section. \nClick the Contacts, Leads, or Accounts tab depending on the record type that you want to map. \nClick Get Started in the Automatically Create and Map Stages section. \nPreviously Mapped Stages\nPlease note, if you have previously run the automapping feature, the Get Started button will display Create & Auto-Map Stages instead. The process is otherwise the same.\nYou will see a modal with additional details about how Apollo automatically creates and maps stages. When you're ready to start the process, click Proceed. \nClick the drop-down and then click an unmapped Salesforce field. \nWhen you're finished, click Create and Map to run the automation based on the selected field. \nApollo has now automatically mapped the field status you selected. Repeat this process for any additional mappings you'd like to create automatically. \nUnmapped Stages Without Matching Salesforce Values\nPlease note, if an unmapped value from Salesforce does not match a stage in Apollo, Apollo will automatically create a stage and map the two together. If an unmapped value from a Salesforce field matches an existing stage, but that stage is already mapped to a different value, Apollo will not map the Salesforce field to the existing stage. Apollo will also not attempt to create a new stage and match the two together since that would incorrectly create a duplicate for an existing stage.\nBack to Top\nStage Mapping Best Practices\nTo prevent stage mapping errors between Salesforce and Apollo:\nMap all stages 1:1.\nMap each stage in your CRM to a corresponding stage in Apollo.\nDon't map more than one stage to the same field in Salesforce.\nMake sure the stage name matches.\nThis is very important to remember if you plan to automatically create and map stages. However, you can also manually map stages that don't share the same name.\nStay on top of housekeeping.\nDelete old or unused stages.\nMove the contacts from the old stages into the correct, active, mapped stage.\nNever Stop Learning!\nNeed a splash more of Salesforce guidance?

{"Topic":"Use Stage Triggers to\u200b Manage and Track Sales Engagement \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Watch the Video\nOverview\nStage Triggers are events in Sequences that automatically change the state of a Contact or Account. For example, you can set a trigger to change a Contact's stage to Approaching when your email to them is delivered, and then change their stage to Replied when they reply.\nRefer to the steps below to create and edit different types of triggers.\nBack to Top\nTrigger Conditions\nA condition needs to be met at each Contact Stage before the trigger activates. Refer to the list below for the different conditions.\nEmail Trigger Conditions\nProspect Created: The initial stage for Contacts when you add them to your Apollo Account. This is generally done with Lead Requests, CSV uploads, or integration with your CRM. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Not Interested.\"\nEmail Delivered: A Contact receives an email. This is only delivery, and not to whether or not the email is opened. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Approaching.\"\nEmail Bounced: An email to the Contact bounces. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Bad Data\" or \"No Email.\"\nProspect Unsubscribed: A Contact opts out of email contact. This happens if you turn on unsubscribe links in your emails in your User Settings. \nThis stage should always be set to \"Do Not Contact.\"\nProspect Replied: A Contact responds to an email you sent. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Replied,\" but your success metrics may differ.\nAppointment or Email Marked as Interested: You book a meeting with a Contact or they're marked as \"Interested\" in a sequence. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Interested.\"\nUnresponsive: A Contact does not respond, but you may want to reach out to them again later. \nThe recommended setting for this stage is \"Unresponsive.\"\nBack to Top\nCall Trigger Conditions\nIn addition to the conditions outlined above, the Call Dispositions you've set up can also be used as Call Trigger stages to set for your Contacts. Refer to the \"Create Call Dispositions to Log Your Calls\" article for more information.\nAccount Trigger Conditions\nThere is only one Account Trigger condition: \"When an account is created.\"\nBack to Top\nEdit Email Triggers\nFollow the steps below to edit Email Triggers.\nLaunch Apollo and click Settings.\nClick Contacts.\nClick Triggers.\nA table with two columns is shown.

{"Topic":"Sequence Statistics Overview \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nEach sequence in Apollo has its own set of statistics.\nThis data is divided into two categories:\nContact Stage statistics\nEmail Tracking statistics\nRefer to the sections below for additional details about each type.\nBack to Top\nContact Stage Statistics\n\"Contact Stage\" statistics are available on the lefthand side of the sequence screen.\nClick for Additional Details\nPlease note, clicking on an individual statistic will bring you to the relevant stage in your sequence's Contacts tab.\n\"Contact Stage\" statistics provide the following data points:\nActive: The total number of contacts who are currently in the sequence\nPaused: The total number of contacts who are currently in the sequence, but are paused on a certain step\nFinished: The total number of contacts who have either completed the sequence or met a Mark sequence as finished trigger in the sequence's Settings tab\nBounced: The total number of contacts who had their email bounce after receiving a message in the sequence\nNot sent: The total number of contacts who have met a Mark as failed when trigger in the sequence's Settings tab\nBack to Top\nEmail Tracking Statistics\nPotential Data Mismatch\nPlease note, the totals in the Delivered and Open categories will rarely line up with the Overview tab and the Emails tab. This is because the Emails tab shows stats relative to the emails themselves, rather than the contacts who were emailed. The Overview tab shows stats relative to those contacts. It's possible to deliver more than one message to a contact in a sequence and this explains the discrepancy.\n\"Email Tracking\" statistics are available on the righthand side of the sequence screen.\nClick for Additional Details\nPlease note, clicking on an individual statistic will bring you to the relevant stage in your sequence's Emails tab.\n\"Email Tracking\" statistics provide the following data points:\nScheduled: The total number of contacts currently scheduled to receive a message in the sequence\nDelivered: The total number of contacts who have been delivered at least one message in the sequence\nOpen: The total number of contacts who have opened at least one message in the sequence\nClick: The total number of contacts who have clicked at least one link in the sequence's messages\nReply: The total number of contacts who have replied to at least one of the sequence's messages\nInterested: The total number of contacts who were marked as interested after receiving one of the sequence's messages, or accepting a calendar invite\nOpt out: The total number of contacts who have clicked an opt-out (unsubscribe) link in one of the sequence's messages\nAggregate statistics are determined by the total number of emails delivered in the sequence. The overall sequence percentages are calculated by dividing by the total number of emails delivered. When you hover your mouse over the percentages, you will then see the numerical count for that stat.\nIn the example above, the 82.2% open rate for the sequence is determined by the total number of open emails (106) divided by the total number of delivered emails (129). Email stats in individual sequence steps are calculated the same way as the aggregate\u2014dividing by the total number of emails delivered for that one message.\nWhere is My Mind...er...Data?\nPlease note, if you delete contacts from your account, Apollo reflects this change in the statistics header under the \"Emails\" tab.\nApollo deletes the records of any emails that you sent to the deleted contacts; however, the \u201cOverview\u201d tab still displays statistics for every email that you have sent since you activated the sequence.\nBack to Top"}

{"Topic":"Build an Outbound Sales Process: Additional Considerations \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Setting the Scene\nOutbound sales is a living, breathing process. It is unlikely that there will ever be a time when you can just sit back and admire your work. In order to keep up with changing customer demand, emerging technologies, and potential blockers to your success, you need to constantly revisit, analyze, and improve your process.\nAt Apollo, we\u2019ve adopted the ABE mantra, \u201cAlways Be Experimenting.\u201d And while this is a somewhat tired and overwrought trope, it has persisted for so long because there is merit to this method. There are a number of key factors that you should keep in mind as you experiment and revise your approach, some of which include adjusting techniques, confirming the validity of your metrics, avoiding SPAM filters, and choosing the right approach for your business.\nThe sections below provide more context about some additional strategies you can take to improve your outbound sales process.\nABE: Always Be Experimenting\nSticking with the same outbound strategy for a prolonged period of time is likely to yield diminishing returns. Customer needs and demands change frequently and you need to remain agile to stay ahead of the curve. Here are a few best practices you should consider as you experiment with your outbound sales strategy:\nTest a different combination of targets\/segments and messaging every day with a sample size of about 200 contacts.\nCheck your metrics\/analytics every day. \nIf your Open Rate is less than 30%-40%, you may have a problem with your targets or email subject lines.\nIf your Interested Rate is less than 0.5%, you may have an issue with your targets or your email messaging.\nOpen Rate and Interested Rate are most important to consider when you are looking for incremental improvement\nTweak your campaign with different messaging as needed or run a new campaign with different targeting and messaging to compare the outcomes.\nUtilize Apollo\u2019s robust Reporting and Dashboards so you can view all of the important information for your Sequences at a glance. \nThe Business Performance Overview dashboard comes pre-built with Apollo and is a great starting point.\nUltimately, testing new things every day helps you to learn about your customer base and incrementally improve your overall analytics\/data system.\nAvoid Getting SPAM Blocked\nThere is no magic bullet for avoiding SPAM blockers entirely, but there are a few different tactics you can employ to help limit their impact on your outbound email campaigns. If you notice that your email Open Rate has dropped to 10% or lower, SPAM filters are likely blocking your messages before they even reach a contact\u2019s inbox.\nEveryone Is Different!\nPlease note, the tips and guidelines below are only meant to serve as best practices and can in no way guarantee that you will eliminate all instances of SPAM blocked emails. SPAM filtering is user-specific\u2014if someone marks an email as spam, their email service provider's spam filtering will update itself to catch similar emails in the future. Two people can receive the same email and encounter different filtering behavior.\nThe following list provides some additional considerations for email body content:\nRemove Links from the Body of Your Email: SPAM filters look for links, especially in first-contact emails. They also scan your signature for links as well. Make sure you've removed links from your signature as well as in the body of your emails.\nRemove Images from the Body of Your Email: Images or attachments, especially in first-contact emails, can activate SPAM blockers and cause bounces. Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for Step 3 or later in your sequence once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\nDon't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text: Simply put, SPAM blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\nKeep Your Paragraphs Concise: Lengthy content can activate SPAM blockers or even cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\nAvoid Words that Trigger SPAM Filters: SPAM filters have evolved considerably in the past few years, and as such, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. In general, try to communicate in a professional, personable way and avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. This HubSpot article provides a comprehensive list of words or phrases that you should avoid. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself.\nA\/B Test Your Messaging: Always test out your messaging to find what results in the highest engagement. You can A\/B test in Apollo to try multiple versions of a similar message. If you find one version is blocked at a higher rate, you can look at the differences in your messaging to try to understand the cause.\nInclude an Unsubscribe Link in Your Email Signature: Apollo allows you to use whatever text\/phrase you'd prefer in an opt-out link and automatically adds the link with your signature on all of the emails you send through the platform. Research shows that recipients are far more likely to use an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as SPAM. Marking your emails as SPAM can affect your overall sending reputation and is, therefore, a much worse outcome.\nDeactivate Click Tracking: Click tracking manipulates links in emails, which SPAM filters can sometimes detect. Disable this feature if you're having issues by deactivating it in each user's profile. For additional information, please see the \"Click Tracking in Apollo\" article.\nDeactivate Open Tracking: The same technology for open and click tracking is usually very sensitive to filters in email servers. This makes them more susceptible to SPAM blockers. If this is something you've struggled with and you have followed the instructions provided above as best practice, you may want to consider disabling open tracking. For additional information, please see the \"Open Tracking Overview\" article.\nGoogle has a great guide available on their Gmail Help site called \u201cPrevent mail to Gmail users from being blocked or sent to spam.\" Consider reviewing this if you plan to email Gmail users. We also have extensive technical documentation on the Knowledge Base to provide you with details and techniques to avoid email servers flagging your emails as SPAM or harming your domain reputation.\nAvoid SPAM Filters\nSet Up Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to Authenticate Your Emails\nSet Up Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) to Authenticate Your Email\nSet Up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Records to Authorize Your Emails\nWarm Up Your Domain\nThere may be many different reasons why you move to a new email domain, but all of them require you to build credibility and \u201cwarm-up\u201d your domain before you can send out emails en masse.\nEmail delivery services such as Google and Microsoft always monitor the rate at which their users send messages in order to prevent spammers from abusing their services. While they have traditionally only looked at the number of messages their users send per hour and per day, many services are now looking at how many messages users send per minute as well.\nFor example, Google Suite's hard limits are 400 emails per hour and 2000 emails per rolling 24-hour period. This means they never allow any of their users to send more than that number of emails via an individual mailbox.\nDomain warming helps you to establish a sending reputation for a domain that is brand new or has not been used to send email in a long time. This process requires you to start with a lower volume of sent emails and gradually increase that volume at each interval (whether that\u2019s a day or a week). To do this, send a reasonable volume of emails with a low amount of bounces and SPAM complaints. Over time, you will develop a better reputation with your email service provider and you can send a higher volume of emails without having your account rate limited or suspended.\nRate Limits!?\nIf you are rate limited or suspended by your email service provider, it means that you've sent too much bad content or too many emails per day or hour. You should immediately lower your sending limits in Apollo, edit the content of any emails you're sending that received a high rate of SPAM complaints, and follow any further instructions given by your email provider to get back in their good graces.\nUse Alternate Domains and Employ White Labeling\nSetting up multiple domains for your outbound sales outreach helps to reduce the load on your primary mail server. It also helps to preserve your domain reputation when you need to send a higher volume of emails than your ESP allows.\nFor example, Apollo may send emails from one of the following servers for the same outreach campaign:\napollo.io\ntryapollo.io\napollomail.io\nWhite labeling your domain improves your deliverability and Email Service Provider (ESP) reputation. A Sender Policy Framework (SPF) lets you specify the mail servers that you authorize to send emails for your domain and helps to prevent against domain spoofing. This helps your recipients (and more specifically, their ESP) identify potential phishing or fraudulent messages that appear to come from your company. DomainKeys Identified Mail Standard (DKIM) is a similar security measure that helps to prevent spammers from impersonating your domain when they reach out to your prospects. You can configure DKIM in your domain provider\u2019s DNS settings to sign your emails with a unique signature that allows a recipient\u2019s server to verify that the sender is really you and that the message was not altered after you sent it.\nBlame the Mail Server!\nThe information you need to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM is specifically related to your own domain and is not in any way related to Apollo. Apollo doesn't have email servers so all emails are sent directly from your email provider. Instructions to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM vary by domain provider. You should contact your domain provider directly to obtain this information and receive any support that you need.\nStart With A Lower Daily Volume and Gradually Ramp Up\nSending limits for emails may seem counter-intuitive to your goals, but the limits set in Apollo help protect your email accounts. Whether you send through Apollo or not, your email provider limits the number of emails that you can send if they suspect you of spamming large amounts of people that you don't know.\nMore on Rate Limits!?\nPlease note, the daily\/hourly limits monitored by your email provider include all emails from the mailbox and through other connected tools (like Apollo). If you send a high volume of emails from your email client, you should lower your limits in Apollo.\nWhenever you start a new campaign that includes any kind of A\/B testing, you should start with a lower daily volume. After you have data to support your targeting and messaging (typically, Interested Rates that are higher than 0.5% and ideally greater than 1%), you can consider increasing email volume and including more contacts in your outreach.\nGenerally, in the Apollo platform, we advise that you stick with the default mailbox setting of 400 emails per day and 100 per hour. If you want to increase the sending limits, you should do so gradually.\nDaily Limit: Increase by no more than 100 each week until you reach 1500 emails\/day. You should never go beyond this limit if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\nHourly Limit: Increase by no more than 20 each week until you reach 400 emails\/hour. Never go beyond 400 emails\/hour if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\nUse Custom Tracking Subdomains\nA Tracking Domain is a secondary (or sub) domain name related to your original domain. It allows Apollo to redirect a tracking pixel added to emails to track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.\nTracking pixels are often flagged as SPAM. To improve the delivery rates for the emails you send through Apollo, you can set up a custom Tracking Subdomain. This can be a somewhat technical process and is best undertaken by someone like an IT professional who understands the intricacies involved in the process.\nFor more details about how to set up a tracking subdomain, check out our \u201cSet Up a Custom Tracking Subdomain (URL)\u201d article.\nIntegrate Third-Party Tools Like Sendgrid\/Mailgun\nTools like Sendgrid and Mailgun allow you to send a higher volume of emails that can bypass the regular sending limits imposed by major email providers. These kinds of tools help to take some of the pressure off of you when you are considering domain reputation and are warming up your domain.\nMore specifically, SendGrid allows you to send up to 6000 emails per day and 500 emails per hour. If you plan to send a high volume of emails each day, a tool like Sendgrid or Mailgun is extremely beneficial.\nHigh Volume vs. High Touch\nDifferent types of customers require different levels of interaction to close deals. It\u2019s important to consider the amount of manual effort you will need to take with each customer. You should then weigh that level of involvement and time against the contract value of a particular customer.\nA few of the approaches you may consider, in order of lowest touch to highest touch:\nAutomatic emails only\nAutomatic and manual emails\nAutomatic and manual emails and phone calls\nBefore you decide on the right approach for your company, consider all of the factors below as you design your outbound sales process.\nConsider the Size of Your ICP Segment\nSales teams can vary just as much as individual customers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that works for everyone. Ultimately, you should take a look at size and bandwidth and choose the approach that makes the most sense for your team.\nIt goes without saying that higher touch often yields better results because you can personalize each touchpoint for each contact to best suit their needs. However, this may not always be possible, especially when you\u2019re working with hundreds or thousands of potential contacts in a segment.\nAs a rule of thumb, if you\u2019ve got a large segment with hundreds of prospects, using a more automated approach may work best for you\u2014especially if you have a small team with limited resources. If your segment ends up on the smaller side (fewer than 100 contacts), as time permits, you may want to incorporate more manual emails into your strategy. People respond better to things that feel like they are worth their time. Highly individualized messaging can go a long way in bridging this gap.\nConsider Your Deal Economics\nThe size and popularity of a prospect account may ultimately play into your outbound sales strategy. Typically, larger businesses mean higher potential contract values, but more manual engagement.\nDoes your business have a particular strategy for the type of companies you go after? Are you more focused on smaller, faster to close deals or does your business rely on large scale deals that may take months to close?\nIf you\u2019re primarily focused on closing larger deals, you can expect more manual, hands on interactions with your prospects, while smaller deals may allow for more automization. You may want to send manual emails or follow up with phone calls for higher-value deals and other scenarios that may necessitate it.\nConsider How \u201cHard to Get\u201d Your Audience May Be\nFortune 500 companies (and other large scale companies) are very much a part of the public sphere and receive a large influx of marketing emails every single day. A SVP-Level contact at a Fortunate 500 company is a lot less likely to open (and even less likely to respond) a mass email that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\nOn the flip side, a manager at an SMB is unlikely to receive as many marketing emails. They may also be more likely to open one that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\nKeep in mind, you might need to evolve your strategy as you go. Analyze your results on a daily basis to find new patterns to improve your outreach. These are not hard and fast rules. You will need to observe the specific trends of your business to make the most informed decision for your sales strategy.\nWrap It Up\nNow that you\u2019ve learned lots of techniques to shape your outbound sales strategy, it\u2019s time to get out there and start building your own from the ground up. Remember, this is always going to be a work in progress\u2014techniques that worked for you last year, last month, or even yesterday may not work tomorrow. Don\u2019t be afraid to reevaluate and restrategize every step of the way. Data is your friend. Keeping a close eye on it will help you to stay ahead of the trends and shifts in your customer segments."}

{"Topic":"Which Apollo record owner is assigned to a contact or account in Salesforce? \u2013 Apollo.io","Content":"Overview\nWhen you create a contact or account in Apollo, the system considers you, the user logged in to Apollo, as the owner of the record. This is slightly different from what occurs when Apollo synchronizes records (which may include contact or account creation, emails, tasks, and calls) to Salesforce. In this instance, Apollo uses your personal Salesforce credentials (if they have been authenticated), the Salesforce account used as the Team Sync credentials, or the credentials from the authenticated user with the most permissions.\nRefer to the sections below for an explanation of how record ownership works.\nBack to Top\nPersonal Salesforce Login Connected\nGenerally speaking, when you have your personal Salesforce credentials linked to your Apollo account, the system will always use your user-specific account to sync contact and account ownership and the activity logs for emails, tasks, and calls to Salesforce.\nThere are specific cases when Apollo assigns a different record creator when you sync to Salesforce.
