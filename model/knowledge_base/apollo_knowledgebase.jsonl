For a list of supported ESPs and standards, sneak a peek at [Supported Email Service Providers (ESPs)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140697101).\n\nA Big Difference\n\nYour _user email_ is your login to Apollo. You can also sign in to your Apollo account with any of your linked mailboxes. However, your _linked mailboxes_ sends your messages, not your _user email_,. You must link a mailbox to start sending those sweet, sweet emails.\n\nRefer to the following steps to link your mailboxes to Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Avoid Special Characters[](#toc_2)\n\nBefore connecting a mailbox, keep in mind that Apollo considers email addresses that use the following characters to be invalid:\n\n*   example--domain.com\n*   example..domain.com\n*   example@.domain.com\n*   example.@domain.com\n*   example-@domain.com\n*   example@-domain.com\n\nIf your email address includes any of these characters, please consider connecting an alternative mailbox.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Link Your Mailbox (Gmail and Outlook)[](#toc_3)\n\nGoogle Groups, Beware!\n\nApollo does not support Google groups. If you try to link a Google group to Apollo instead of an individual mailbox, you'll be left high and dry!\n\nTo link your mailbox to Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**Mailboxes**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account/mailboxes).\n2.  Click **Link mailbox** to add a new mailbox.

Choose either **Google** or **Outlook** as your email provider. If you are already signed in to your email account, select the account that you want to link. Otherwise, you need to provide your email account credentials.\n    \n    Click the checkbox to agree to Apollo's terms of service, then click **Link mailbox**.

Apollo's guidance helps you optimize your mailbox setup.\n    \n    When you finish a step, click **Complete** to move to the next step. If you prefer to not address a step, click **Skip this step**.\n    \n6.  Add a [signature](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140295949) to the emails you send from your mailbox. Emails sent directly from your connected mailbox outside of Apollo will not include your Apollo email signature.

Set your [email sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005) to control the number of emails being sent from your mailbox. If your sending limits are set too high, you are more likely to encounter deliverability issues.

You need to make sure you deliver the right message, to the right people, at the right time, and to the right email domain.\n\nEmail verification is an essential cog in the motion of any email engagement workflow. It is the process of validating the authenticity and accuracy of an email address before you send any messages to your ideal **contacts**.\n\nThere are many advantages to email verification, including:\n\n*   Protect the health and reputation of your email domain\n*   Increase your email delivery rates and ensure your message reaches the right people in the right inboxes\n*   Identify stale data before you message **contacts** on outdated or invalid email addresses that can harm your domain reputation and decrease your engagement rates\n*   Reduce the risk of being flagged as SPAM\n\nRefer to the sections below for more information about how email verification tools work and what catch-all emails mean for your campaigns.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Email Verification Tools[](#toc_2)\n\nMany people use email verification tools such as ZeroBounce, Mailfloss, Neverbounce, or Hunter to help protect their domain reputation and increase the performance of their email campaigns. However, if you use a third-party email verification tool in conjunction with Apollo, it can often be [counterproductive](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10619188727309#toc_4) to the success of your [sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview).\n\nEvery third-party email verification tool has developed its own process to verify your emails. This means that the effectiveness or reliability of email verification relies greatly on the specific process of the tool you choose. Most competent tools include steps such as:\n\n*   A syntax check to ensure there are no typos or questionable characters in the email address\n*   A domain check to verify the existence of the domain name on which the email is hosted\n*   An email ping to check that the specific email address exists\n\nAlthough these techniques can be effective, they can also greatly affect your coverage. For example, if an email service is temporarily unreachable when the verification tool checks its domain, you exclude all the emails from an organization in one swift check.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of popular email verification tools use a method called SMTP tickling.\n\nHold the Phone, What's that?\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for sending messages. Most email verification tools leverage SMTP tickling to ask an email service if an email exists, thereby verifying its validity before you send any messages to it.\n\nSMTP tickling does not differentiate between valid and invalid \"[catch-all emails](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10619188727309#toc_3)\". Therefore, this method does not confirm if the email address will link you to the right person, or if your messages will be auto-dumped into a default inbox that no one will see.\n\nIt's Not All Doom and Gloom\n\nAlthough catch-all domains can still lead you to the right person; when you use third-party verification tools, is it very difficult to guarantee that they will. Hop into the [Email Verification: The Apollo Process](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381) article to learn more about how Apollo's robust, built-in email verification process helps you to overcome this issue.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that a third-party tool is not an all-encompassing solution. Several factors impact your bounce rate, some of which email verification tools cannot help you with. For more information, refer to the \"[Email Accuracy](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_5)\" section of the \"Email Verification: The Apollo Process\" article.\n\nRead on to find out more about what catch-all emails are and why they matter.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Catch-All Emails[](#toc_3)\n\nCatch-all emails are the email addresses that belong to a catch-all mail server. This means that if you send an email to any address that belongs to a specific domain name\u2014even if the address does not exist, or is written incorrectly\u2014the catch-all mail server accepts your email.\n\nIt's Polyonymous!\n\nYou may have heard of the terms \"accept-all emails\" or \"wildcard email aliases\" too. Fear not, observant souls\u2014catch-all emails go by many names but the same definition applies to them all.\n\nHere's an example of how catch-all emails can be problematic for your campaigns:\n\n| Domain Name | Existing Email Addresses from Example Domain | Catch-All Inbox | Invalid Email Address |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| exampledomain.com | bob@exampledomain.com, jane@exampledomain.com, craig@exampledomain.com, tim@exampledomain.com | info@exampledomain.com | terry@exampledomain.com |\n\nYou have an email for Terry at Example. His email is `terry@exampledomain.com`. However, Terry stopped working at Example 1 month ago and the company is yet to replace him. Example has 4 existing employee email addresses, plus 1 catch-all email address. This means that even though Terry left the company and his email address is no longer valid, the message you send to `terry@exampledomain.com` will land in the catch-all `info@exampledomain.com` inbox.\n\nCatch-all email servers exist so that important emails still reach a company inbox, despite sender errors. For this reason, a large number of companies have a catch-all email server. However, with the rise in spammers taking advantage of catch-all email domains, only some companies still dedicate resources to keep on top of reviewing the emails in their catch-all inboxes.\n\nIn short, if no one checks this catch-all inbox regularly, chances are the emails that land there won't be seen by anyone, let alone opened or read by the specific person you are trying to reach.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Apollo-Verified Emails[](#toc_4)\n\n[![Email Verified on Search Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_verification_a_brief_introduction/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_verification_a_brief_introduction/i1.png)\n\nThird-party email verification tools sometimes flag Apollo-verified emails as invalid. This is because most tools cannot distinguish between valid and invalid catch-all emails.\n\nMany of the business emails from **contacts** that you prospect in Apollo could have a catch-all domain. This means that when you rely on third-party email verification tools\u2014unless you are willing to invest hours and hours manually verifying which catch-all emails are valid\u2014you will most likely rule out all catch-all emails from your lists. When you do so, you risk losing a big chunk of the potentially qualified company domains in your pipeline.\n\nHowever, there is a much easier, more accurate alternative. Apollo already includes a built-in email verification process with a **91% email accuracy rate** that can differentiate between valid and invalid catch-all emails. This means that you do not need to use a third-party verification tool alongside Apollo. Instead, when you rely upon Apollo's verified emails you know that you automatically include the valid catch-all domains in your **sequences** and exclude the invalid ones. As a result, you are better equipped to reach more of your ideal **contacts** without putting your domain reputation at risk.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Next Steps[](#toc_5)\n\n[![Next Steps Graphic](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_verification_a_brief_introduction/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_verification_a_brief_introduction/i2.png)\n\nNow that you have learned more about email verification tools and catch-all emails, jump into the [Email Verification: The Apollo Process](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381) article to find out more about Apollo's verification process, why it is different, and what it means for the success of your email campaigns.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10619188727309-Email-Verification-A-Brief-Introduction"}
{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nIf you've used an email verification tool like Neverbounce, Zerobounce, Briteverify, or another similar tool, you may wonder why they sometimes flag Apollo-verified emails as unverifiable. In a nutshell, here's why:\n\nMost third-party tools can identify if a domain is active. Some can confirm if a domain is [catch-all](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_7). But very few can detect at the mailbox level whether a specific email address from a catch-all domain exists or not.\n\nThis is because the majority of popular tools use a method called SMTP tickling.\n\nHold the Phone, What's that?\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for sending messages. Most email verification tools leverage SMTP tickling to ask an email service if an email exists, thereby verifying its validity before you send any messages to it.\n\nSMTP tickling cannot differentiate between valid and invalid emails from a catch-all domain. Therefore, this method cannot confirm if the email address does exist and will link you to the right person or if your messages will be auto-dumped into a default inbox that no one will see.\n\nCatch-all domains can still lead you to qualified contacts. However, when you use most third-party verification tools it's very difficult to guarantee they will. No one wants to gamble with your domain reputation. Hence the catch-22 dilemma: include these emails in your email outreach and you put your domain at risk. Leave them out and you risk losing a chunk of potentially qualified leads.\n\n**Unless you use Apollo. We do things differently.**\n\n## What Apollo Does Differently[](#toc_2)\n\nAt Apollo, we have a built-in email verification process with a [91% accuracy rate](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_11) that does not rely solely on SMTP tickling to validate emails. Our 7-step email verification process **can** differentiate between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains. This means that when you send an email to an Apollo-verified contact with a catch-all domain, your email will land in the right inbox.\n\nFeeling skeptical?\n\nWe feel you. You don't want to put your domain at risk\u2014and quite rightly too. Remember though\u2014your success is our success. We value every one of our Apolloers and do not gamble with your reputation.\u00a0Check out [the FAQs below](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_6) or reach out to our [friendly support team](mailto: support@apollo.io) to discuss any concerns you may have.\n\nSo what makes us different from other verification tools? As a B2B database provider, lead data is the bread and butter of Apollo's business. Providing accurate data and verifying emails is integral to the success of all Apollo users. To maintain the highest level of data consistency and accuracy, Apollo has a 7-step email verification process in place. This process takes advantage of Apollo's large datasets.\n\n### Apollo Datasets[](#toc_3)\n\nApollo collects and verifies data against multiple data sources to identify the best source of truth. Data sources include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   The Apollo data contributor network\n*   Public data crawling\n*   Carefully vetted third-party data providers\n\nBy running checks against our large datasets, Apollo effectively verifies emails in real time, handles catch-all domains, predicts email bounces, and automatically cleans emails. Third-party email verification tools cannot leverage such insights to gain the same level of accuracy and granularity when verifying emails\u2014especially when they are from catch-all domains.\n\n### The 7-Step Apollo Process[](#toc_4)\n\nApollo goes one step further than most verification tools to confirm that an account may or may not exist,\n\nMany users email prospects daily through Apollo to find and contact qualified leads and track the deliverability and success of their **sequences**. This means that Apollo does not only use advanced technologies to run syntax, domain, and email checks to determine the validity of each email. Apollo also leverages its insightful data to check and confirm if a real person is actively using an email. Within the 7-step email verification process, Apollo can:\n\n*   Check and validate emails against Apollo-connected inboxes, CRMs, and CSV uploads\n*   Track email delivery statistics\n*   Monitor email bounce-rates\n\nTherefore, when you request and spend 1 credit on a verified email in Apollo, you can be sure of 2 important points:\n\n*   Apollo can provide greater email coverage for contacts vs. third-party email verification services because we do not eliminate a valid email just because it belongs to a catch-all domain.\n*   Apollo has gathered ample evidence that the email does exist and will reach an actual person's inbox\n\nCurious about Credits?\n\nFor more information about how credits work in Apollo, please refer to the \"[What Are Credits?](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9527776320781-What-Are-Credits-)\" article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Follow Email Best Practices[](#toc_5)\n\nNow that you have read about the Apollo verification process and know why you may encounter conflicting results between Apollo-verified data and third-party verification tools, it's time to address the elephant in the room: Sending messages to verified emails is essential, but it's only one part of the magic potion. Even the best verification tool is not an all-encompassing solution. Several factors impact your bounce rate, including low open rates and recipients flagging your emails as SPAM.\n\nIf you want to make sure you're doing everything you can to keep your domain healthy and improve your deliverability rates when sending emails through Apollo, feast your eyes on these resources:\n\n*   [Apollo's Cold Email Deliverability Checklist](https://21165194.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21165194/Apollo%E2%80%99s%20Cold%20Email%20Deliverability%20Checklist%20(final)%20(1)%20copy.pdf)\n*   [Avoid SPAM Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-SPAM-Filters)\n*   [Why Do I See Such a High Bounce Rate for Emails from Apollo?](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409227148045)\n\nMore questions Running Through Your Magnificent Mind?\n\nWe know.

Fear not young padawan\u2014catch-all emails go by many names but the same definition applies to them all.\n\nHere's an example of how unverified catch-all emails can be problematic for your campaigns:\n\n| Domain Name | Existing Email Addresses from Example Domain | Catch-All Inbox | Invalid Email Address |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| exampledomain.com | bob@exampledomain.com, jane@exampledomain.com, craig@exampledomain.com, tim@exampledomain.com | info@exampledomain.com | terry@exampledomain.com |\n\nYou have an email for Terry at Example. His email is `terry@exampledomain.com`. However, Terry stopped working at Example 1 month ago and the company is yet to replace him. Example has 4 existing employee email addresses, plus 1 catch-all email address. This means that even though Terry left the company and his email address is no longer valid, the message you send to `terry@exampledomain.com` will land in the catch-all `info@exampledomain.com` inbox.\n\nWith the rise in spammers taking advantage of catch-all email domains, only some companies still dedicate resources to keep on top of reviewing the emails in their catch-all inboxes. If you send a message to an invalid email from a catch-all domain and your message lands in an inbox that no one checks regularly, it's unlikely anyone will see it. It's even less likely the specific person you are trying to reach will open or read it. This can lead to lower open rates and over time, can affect your domain reputation.\n\nHowever, many companies have a catch-all email server because they allow important emails to reach a company inbox, despite sender errors. So let's say Terry never left the company and his email does still exist. If you don't email him, you'll miss out on a potential deal just because his email address belongs to a catch-all domain.\n\nLuckily, at Apollo, we can distinguish between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains. Refer to the [What Apollo Does Differently](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_2) section above for more info.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Why Do Third-Party Tools Flag Apollo-Verified Emails as Unverifiable?[](#toc_8)\n\nIn short, as lead data is the bread and butter of Apollo's business, we can collect and verify data against [multiple data sources](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_3) that third-party verification tools cannot. We do not solely rely on [SMTP tickling](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381#toc_1) to verify if a mailbox exists, which means we can distinguish between valid and invalid emails from catch-all domains when other verification tools cannot.

It also includes emails where Apollo has low confidence in their validity. | Please note that if Apollo cannot verify the emails you edit or upload, Apollo marks them as unverified. If you want Apollo to validate a contact's unverified email, you can choose to enrich the email. For more information about Apollo enrichment, please refer to the [Enrich section](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us#category-18201639822477) of the Apollo KB. | You can upload new contacts or edit saved emails at no cost.

For this reason, there may be instances where you need to show search results for people for which Apollo has a verified email.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nApollo categorizes emails into 2 types:\n\n*   **Business**: The email address that a contact uses specifically for work purposes. For example: `contactnameexample@apollo.io`.\n*   **Personal**: The email address that a contact uses for private affairs outside of working hours. For example: `contactnameexample252@gmail.com`.\n\nBy default, Apollo sets your primary email to a business email address. However, factors such as your industry, ideal customer profiles, and campaign objectives often dictate the type of email address that best fits your prospecting needs. For example, if you are in the recruiting industry, you are more likely to need a contact's personal email. If you sell to a B2B market, you are more likely to engage with a contact through their business email.\n\nGDPR Has the Last Word!\n\nYou can't access the personal emails of contacts from the EU, UK, and Switzerland due to [GDPR](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409141087757) restrictions. Keep calm and keep compliant.\n\nRefer to the sections below to find out how to change your primary email type and how to access a contact's personal email when you use Apollo's search.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Change Your Primary Email Type[](#toc_1)\n\nIf you are not an admin, you cannot access the necessary settings to change your primary email type. Please contact your Apollo admins for help.\n\nIf you are an admin, you can change your primary email at any time. However, Apollo only applies the new primary email type to the net new contacts that you request. Apollo does not change the primary email for any existing saved contacts. This means you can change your email type without disrupting the contacts that you already enrolled in a sequence.\n\nMap It Out!\n\nIf you integrated your Apollo account with Salesforce or HubSpot, carefully consider which email type you set as primary. Apollo uses the primary email address when mapping a contact\u2019s data to your CRM. Apollo cannot map secondary emails to a CRM.\n\nTo change your primary email:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** >\u00a0[**Prospecting Config**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/org).\n2.  Find the **Primary Email Address** section. Here, you have 3 options: **Business**, **Personal**, or **Any**.\n    \n    Click the email type that you want to set as primary. Then, click **Save**.\u00a0 [![Primary Email](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/prospect_with_personal_and_business_emails/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/prospect_with_personal_and_business_emails/i2.png)\n    \n    Emails Galore!\n    \n    If you select **Any**, Apollo still sets a contact's business email as the default. However, if Apollo finds both business and personal emails for a contact, you receive both. In this scenario, Apollo only charges you 1 credit for the 2 emails.\n    \n    For more information about email credit charges, refer to [Will Apollo Charge Me For More than One Email Per Contact?](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/6319289281805).\n    \n\nYou have now updated your primary email.

Assuming Apollo finds a contact's verified personal email address, you can view it from that contact's profile page.\n\nWe Have Priorities!\n\nWhen you add a contact to a sequence, Apollo always uses the primary email address. Apollo only displays the secondary email if it can find a verified primary email.\n\nTo access email addresses for a contact:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Search** > [**People**](https://app.apollo.io/#/people).\n2.  Apply filters to refine your search.\n    \n    If your primary email type is **Personal**, you can only filter by email status in the **Saved** tab. If your primary email type is **Business**, you can filter by email Status in both the **Saved** and **Net New** tabs.

The average person does not send more than 50 emails a day\u2014even when they're incredibly active via email.\n\n### Apollo Sending Limits[](#toc_4)\n\nSending limits in Apollo act as an additional safety net to help you adhere to best practices and prevent your ESP from suspending or limiting your email account.\n\nFeeling Limited?\n\nWant to increase the emails you send but don't want to put your reputation on the line? Apollo allows you to [connect multiple mailboxes](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io) to increase the total volume of emails you send per day without putting your domain at risk.\n\nTo gain more control over the number of emails your team sends via a mailbox connected to Apollo, [configure sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005#toc_4) within Apollo. To keep your email account safe, Apollo advises staying within our [recommended limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005#toc_6).\n\n[![Recommended Limits](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i6.png)\n\nLess Is So Much More!\n\nThe email sending science is simple. In general, the lower you set your sending limits, the better your deliverability rates will be. Although you have the flexibility to [edit your sending limits in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005#toc_4) for each connected mailbox, we do not recommend increasing your limits beyond 50 emails per day. You raise them at your own risk. If you already have a bad domain reputation, you must lower your sending limits immediately.\n\nRefer to the sections below to access and edit your sending limits for a connected mailbox in Apollo, learn about recommended limits, and jump into related faqs.\n\nReady to Face Your Spam Fears?\n\nGot spam filters on the mind? Sneak a peek at the [Avoid Spam Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-Spam-Filters) article for the best practices to keep your domain safe before you enroll contacts into your [sequences](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Edit Sending Limits in Apollo[](#toc_5)\n\nTo access and edit sending limits:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Settings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account) > [**Mailboxes**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io).\n2.  Apollo displays the\u00a0daily and hourly limits for each connected mailbox. [![Limits](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i4.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i4.png)From here, you can visualize and track your progress towards your daily limits in Apollo. For example, if you set your limits to 50 for a connected mailbox and you've sent 35 emails via Apollo from that mailbox so far that day, Apollo displays 35/50.\n    \n    Only in Apollo\n    \n    Please note, Apollo only tracks the emails you send via Apollo. Any emails you send directly from your mailbox outside of Apollo do not count towards your daily Apollo sending limits.\n    \n3.  To change the limits, click the mailbox you want to edit. [![Edit Limits](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i5.png)\n4.  Click **Set to default** if you want to adhere to Apollo's [recommended sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005-Email-Sending-Limits-Overview#toc_6). [![Set to default button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i8.png)\n5.  Then, click **Reset to default** to confirm the change. Apollo automatically reverts all sending limits for the selected mailbox. [![Reset to default confirmation modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i9.png)\n6.  To manually make changes, edit the fields for daily and hourly limits and the minimum delay between emails. Then, click **Save changes**. [![Save changes button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i7.png)\n    \n    Resist Temptation!\n    \n    We get it. You want to reach as many of your ideal prospects as possible\u2014without restrictions. But your reputation matters. If you overdo it, you risk getting flagged as spam. Nobody likes spam.\n    \n    Want to avoid suspension or sending limitations? Stick within the [recommended limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005#toc_5), follow [email deliverability best practices](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-Spam-Filters#toc_3), and [A/B test your messaging](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597-Add-an-A-B-Test-to-an-Email-Step-in-a-Sequence) to help keep that domain squeaky clean. If you experience deliverability issues, lower your sending limits immediately.\n    \n    Hungry for more tips? Check out our webinar on [mastering email deliverability](https://www.apollo.io/academy/mastering-email-deliverability).\n    \n7.  (Recommended) While you're here, [configure an unsubscribe link](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140379661-Configure-Your-Opt-Out-Unsubscribe-Email-Link) to accompany your email signature. If you give recipients an alternative, they are less likely to flag your email as spam.\n\nWhen you reach your hourly or daily limit for a mailbox, Apollo pauses any scheduled emails until the next hour or day.\n\nDaily limits in Apollo are based on a rolling 24-hour period, not the calendar day. The period begins the moment you turn on a sequence. When you enroll contacts into a sequence, Apollo verifies the number of emails both sent and scheduled to dispatch within the current 24-hour period. Apollo then respects the specified sending limits and pauses any emails that exceed the limit until the next period. If you make any changes to your limits, this influences and determines how many emails Apollo will schedule for the next 24-hour period.\n\nEmail Provider Limits and Apollo\n\nPlease remember that Apollo does not send emails on your behalf. All the mail you send in Apollo is sent via your connected mailbox(es). Your email provider's daily and hourly limits include all emails you send from a mailbox. If you actively use your mailbox outside of Apollo, lower your limits in Apollo to keep your domain safe and avoid disruption to the other emails you send.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Recommended Sending Limits[](#toc_6)\n\nApollo strongly advises you start with the recommended mailbox setting of 50 emails per day, 6 per hour, and with a 600-second delay between emails.\n\nWhile the maximum number of emails you can send from a connected mailbox via Apollo is higher than this, you should start with 50 and monitor your email performance closely. If you notice any deliverability issues, lower your sending limits immediately.\n\nIf you need to increase email volume, add [more mailboxes](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io) and do not increase your sending limits until you have established solid deliverability and domain reputation. If you consistently achieve a 5% or higher reply rate and you have a strong domain reputation, you can increase the number of emails you send per day. However, even then, please remember that higher sending limits often correlate with worse deliverability rates. You increase your sending limits at your own risk.\n\nIt's Not Just a Numbers Game!\n\nWhat you write is as important as who you write to, how many emails you send, and when. Read more about how to write effective sales emails [here](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415045401485-How-Do-I-Write-Effective-Sales-Emails-) or watch [this webinar](https://getapollo.wistia.com/medias/b8xmd2cuw6) for tips on mastering the cold email.\n\nTo send a higher volume of emails without putting your domain at risk:\n\n*   [Link additional mailboxes](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io). Each mailbox has its own sending limits. Depending on your plan, you can add up to 15 mailboxes per user. See the [pricing page](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/plans/upgrade) for more information.\n*   [Integrate with SendGrid](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415867175693-Set-Up-Apollo-s-Integration-with-SendGrid) or [Mailgun](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8688131737229-Integrate-Mailgun-with-Apollo). Apollo recommends you do this if you already actively use SendGrid or Mailgun for transactional or marketing emails related to your service or product. If you don't, consider using [this Apollo partner](https://agencies.apollo.io/partners/senders) to help follow deliverability best practices.\n\nWhy isn't Apollo sending out enough emails to hit my sending limit?\n\nYour Email Service Provider (ESP) sets sending limits, not Apollo. You can configure limits in Apollo to gain some control within the platform. However, if you try to set a large email-sending limit, your ESP might not allow it. ESPs manage this number natively and might automatically limit how many emails an account can send.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## What Happens When I Hit My Limits In Apollo?[](#toc_7)\n\nIf you hit your daily or hourly [sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005#toc_1), Apollo automatically places the remaining emails in the \"scheduled-delayed\" queue until the next day or hour.\n\nTo check the status of your emails:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Emails**](https://app.apollo.io/#/emails).\n2.  You can view the status on the right of each email. [![Email Status](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i2.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/email_sending_limits_overview/i2.png)If the status is \"scheduled-delayed,\" it is likely because you hit your sending limit. If so, Apollo sends the email the following hour or day when the limit refreshes.\n\nBehind Schedule?\n\nIf you see the \"scheduled-delayed\" status and haven't hit your sending limit, it is likely due to your sequence schedule. For more information on how schedules work in Apollo, refer to the [Create and Edit Sequence Schedules](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409477927309-Create-and-Edit-Sequence-Sending-Schedules) article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## What Happens When My Email Provider Limits or Suspends My Account?[](#toc_8)\n\nIf your email service provider suspends or rate limits your email account, it means you've sent too much underperforming content or too many emails per day or hour. You should immediately lower your sending limits in Apollo, check the [sequence stats](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequence), edit the email content of any messages that received a high bounce or spam-blocked rate, and follow any further instructions from your email provider to get back in their good graces.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n*   [Guidelines to Avoid Spam Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885)\n*   [Email Deliverability Checklist](https://21165194.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21165194/Apollo%E2%80%99s%20Cold%20Email%20Deliverability%20Checklist%20(final)%20(1)%20copy.pdf)\n*   [Mastering Email Deliverability Webinar](https://getapollo.wistia.com/medias/n29swfovkx)\n\nHow to Restore a Suspended Gmail Account\n\nIf your email service provider limits your account and you continue to hit their rate limits, they will suspend your account.

{"text": "## Watch the Video[](#toc_1)\n\n## Overview[](#toc_2)\n\nSequences are outreach campaigns with any number of sequential contact points and tasks that you can customize to personally engage your target audiences at scale. They help your team deliver communications to your customers and complete the right tasks at the right time to speed your prospects through your pipeline and turn them into paying customers as efficiently as possible.\u00a0\n\nThe following sections detail the various benefits of using sequences in Apollo along with some best practices.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Why Use Sequences?[](#toc_3)\n\nThere are many benefits to using sequences in Apollo, including the ability to:\n\n*   Save time using automated steps and AI to create compelling content based on the needs of your ideal prospects. Use these time savings to allow your team to work on more high-value, complex tasks.\n*   Leverage Apollo's AI to iterate on your messages. Craft emails with a more consistent tone and voice, while enabling your team more time to be creative.\n*   Institutionalize best practices for engaging leads into easy-to-follow guides that automatically add defined tasks to your Apollo dashboards on set schedules. This ensures consistency and accountability for your sales team.\n*   Achieve better email response rates.\n*   A/B test message templates, scripts, and strategies to confirm the best version of any step in your sales process.\n*   Access reporting to compare and optimize your approach and help you to confirm the best times for every message you send. Reports include specific data relative to your messaging, such as how many messages were delivered, opened, replied to, and bounced.\n\nAs you use Apollo to hone in on your ideal customer profiles, create sequences to match each type of outbound and/or inbound prospect with automatic and manual messages, LinkedIn engagement, calls, and action items that speak directly to the value propositions they want.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Available Steps in a Sequence[](#toc_4)\n\n[![Pick a step.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/sequences_overview/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/sequences_overview/i6.png)\n\nSequence steps are the individual messages and activities you design for your team to successfully engage with prospects. Sequences are made up of as many steps and with as much time between each step as you choose. There are several types of steps, including:\n\n*   **Automatic email**: Use any of your Apollo email templates or create new ones to craft personalized and targeted messaging that is delivered based on the parameters you set.\n*   **Manual email**: Use to schedule and deliver follow-up emails that you can fully customize for individual prospects.\n*   **Phone call**: Add notes, tips, scripts, and any other helpful information with a reminder to call a prospect.\n*   **Action item**: A blank canvas to schedule any number of necessary internal communications or processes along the way. Action items include a timeframe, priority, and notes for your team.\n*   **LinkedIn: Send a connection request**: Create connection request templates to make a great first impression.\n*   **LinkedIn: Send message**: Send personalized messages using templates, [snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093) and [dynamic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813) to personalize your approach at scale.\n*   **LinkedIn: View profile**: Access a contact's LinkedIn profile from within Apollo and document key information that can help you build rapport when engaging with prospects.\n*   **LinkedIn: Interact With post**: Review a contact's activities, engage with their recent posts, and give yourself direction with reminders and relevant notes.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Timing or Spacing Between Steps[](#toc_5)\n\n[![Choose your timing between steps.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/sequences_overview/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/sequences_overview/i5.png)\n\nThere are 2 factors to determine how much time elapses between sequence steps:\n\n*   **Schedule**:\u00a0The sequence schedule sets the time and the day in which Apollo sends messages to prospects.\n*   **When to start this step**: This tells Apollo how long to wait in between each step in a sequence.\n\nFor more information on how to take advantage of sequence schedules and wait time between steps, refer to the [Create and Edit Sequence Sending Schedules](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409477927309).\n\nThe optimal timing for your target audience depends on the type of sales strategy you choose. Research your industry, plan your strategy, and then A/B test to find the approach that works best for your ideal customers. For an example use case of how to leverage Apollo sequences, refer to [Leverage Apollo Email to Increase Your Conversion Rates](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5492860902669).

For example, a sequence can pause for a certain contact if they confirm their interest. In addition, you can set the maximum amount of emails sent per day, among other settings.\n\nRefer to [Create Sequence Rulesets](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/sequence/sequence-rulesets) for help in setting up rulesets for your sequences.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create Sequences[](#toc_7)\n\nYou can create a sequence with or without templates, from scratch, or with the friendly help of Apollo's AI writing tool.\n\nIt's Sequence Time!\n\nReady to create a sequence?

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\n[Search filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview) are powerful parameters that allow you to include or exclude specific data when you search for [people](https://app.apollo.io/#/people) or [companies](https://app.apollo.io/#/companies) and [build lists](https://www.apollo.io/academy/how-to-build-amazing-lead-lists) in Apollo.\n\n[![An example people search is shown](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/troubleshoot_search_filters/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/troubleshoot_search_filters/i1.png)\n\nReview the following sections for a few frequently asked questions about search filters.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions[](#toc_2)\n\n### What's the Difference Between the People and Companies Filters?[](#toc_3)\n\nFor a strategic approach, use company filters to find the businesses most likely to benefit from your product or service. Then, use people filters to find the best individuals to reach out to.\n\nCompany-specific filters allow you to search for companies with search results limited to businesses. You might examine [companies you\u2019ve closed/won](https://app.apollo.io/#/opportunities) and make assumptions about the companies you\u2019re most likely to have success with in the future. With these attributes, you can search Apollo to see how similar companies are performing through filters like [company size](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HV6RMP6NMYTVND7YK2RW9CG1), [industry](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#01HV6V76ZGREM50QAV0QN2BZ12), [location](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HV4F8NT4WN5TZKWCA4NHN91H), [funding](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVMFFPW5M6VJPKS13E6C7RJK), [keywords](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#01HV6V76ZGREM50QAV0QN2BZ12), and more.\n\nPeople-specific filters allow you to search for individuals and employees, with search results limited to people. You can [create personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona) based on your [ideal customer profile](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416471135245-Identify-Your-Ideal-Customer-Profile-ICP). Then use [personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVKZKRHZ49HJ92ZBFCCXCVQG) in a search, combined with other filters like [list](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVKXNZY517JCQNQDGE685P2X) and [email status](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#01HV6S276HFGQRT5CAKXV5112T), to find the right person at the right companies for your message.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve found great prospects, save and add your contacts to [sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview) to begin your outreach.\n\n### How Do I Filter Search Results to Exclude Companies I\u2019ve Already Added to My Lists?[](#toc_4)\n\nTo exclude companies already on your lists:\n\n1.  1.  Click **Search** > [**Companies**](https://app.apollo.io/#/companies).\n    2.  Click the [list filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVKXNZY517JCQNQDGE685P2X) > **Advanced Settings** and select lists under the **Exclude** dropdown.\n\n### Why Are There No Records When I Use the Date Refreshed in Apollo Filter?[](#toc_5)\n\nIf you don't see results, try expanding the refreshed date range. The [date refreshed in Apollo filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVM8ETSJ8H6PC28MM8M93DJN) allows you to search based on when contact data was last updated in Apollo.\n\nApollo makes updates available in [real-time](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19331318468621-Apollo-Data-Overview) whenever it captures a data signal such as a job change or a new phone number or email. You can refresh data on saved contacts so your information stays accurate and up-to-date.\n\n### How Do I Find The Best Person to Email at Each Company?[](#toc_6)\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified a promising company for outreach, [search for people](https://app.apollo.io/#/people) that work at the company with the [persona filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVKZKRHZ49HJ92ZBFCCXCVQG). [Personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona) allow you to target different groups of people with sets of titles, departments, and attributes that define your ideal customer profile. When combined with the [company filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HV4Q9224EQ80SKENB6AXFN1G) or the [list filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HVKXNZY517JCQNQDGE685P2X), you can find the best person to email at each company.\n\nWith your search results, [add them to a sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview) to begin your outreach.\n\n### How Do I Filter for People Who Have Personal Email Addresses?[](#toc_7)\n\nBy default, when you save a contact in Apollo, you access their business email address.\n\nHowever, many factors, such as your industry, ideal customer profile, and campaign objectives may dictate your prospecting strategy. To change your default prospecting configuration to access personal email addresses instead of business email addresses, check out [Prospect with personal emails.](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/6217107598861-Prospect-with-Personal-and-Business-Emails)\n\n### How Do I Find the Phone Numbers of Contacts If I Already Know Their Email Addresses?[](#toc_8)\n\nWhen you request a contact\u2019s phone number, you also make a request for their email address. If you already know contact email addresses, [upload your contacts via CSV](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409161532045-Upload-a-CSV-of-Contacts-to-Apollo). Next, [use CSV enrichment](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226361229-Improve-Your-CSV-Data-With-CSV-Enrichment) to enrich your contact data with phone numbers without enriching emails.\n\nWhen you're ready, [use the dialer](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4734516058893-Make-Calls-with-Local-Phone-Numbers-from-the-Dialer) to reach out and engage.\n\n### Which Filters Aren't Accessible from the Free Plan? How Do I Access Advanced Filters?[](#toc_9)\n\nSome Apollo plans include more filters than others. For updated pricing and availability, check out [Apollo plans](https://www.apollo.io/pricing#compare). To access advanced filters, [upgrade your plan](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/plans). If you have questions about upgrading, [reach out](https://apollo.na.chilipiper.com/router/sales_router?leadsource=Inbound&lead_source_details__c=KnowledgeBase) to the Apollo sales team.\n\nYou can learn more about each filter in [Search Filters Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview).\n\n### How Do I Filter for Contacts Outside of the US?[](#toc_10)\n\nTo filter for contacts outside of the US:\n\n1.  1.  Click **Search** > [**People**](https://app.apollo.io/#/people) > then use the [location filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview#h_01HV4F8NT4WN5TZKWCA4NHN91H).\n    2.  Enter the United States and select **Exclude**.\n\n### How Do I Know Which Buying Topics are Best for Our Company?[](#toc_11)\n\n[Buying intent topics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9296665299213-Buying-Intent-Topics) are most effective when they're narrowly focused on your specific product and market. Use buying intent topics that best reflect the core product or service you offer. For instance, if you\u2019re a travel agent, you might search for \u201ctravel.\u201d\n\nNext, use more granular topics to reflect the use cases your product solves. Like \u201cbusiness expenses\u201d or \u201ctravel fraud.\u201d\n\nFinally, use buying intent topics about your competition, or about topics covering the pain points or challenges your customers see. Like \u201ctravel rewards\" or a competitor travel agency. The more specific and niche your topics are, the more effective your search will be.\n\nWith well-selected buying intent topics, you can gain valuable insight into your pipeline. When Apollo associates your prospects with multiple buying intent topics, you should prioritize them in your outreach as they indicate high relevance to your campaign.\n\nCheck out [Buying Intent Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8047704465933-Buying-Intent-Overview) to learn more about buying intent and intent topics.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/26173216970381-Troubleshoot-Search-Filters"}

To avoid these \"spam blockers\" you need to follow email best practices. If you do not, your emails may bounce and never reach your intended audience. This, in turn, puts your domain health at risk.\n\nRead on to learn how to avoid spam filters and improve email deliverability when you [send emails](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences) via a mailbox connected to Apollo.\n\nLet's (Not) Bounce\n\nPlease note that the guidelines below are only best practices. They are not guaranteed to eliminate all bounces or instances of spam-blocked emails. Spam filtering is user-specific\u2014if someone marks an email as spam, their email service provider's spam filtering will update itself to catch similar emails in the future. Two people can receive the same email and encounter different filtering behavior.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Email Deliverability Best Practices[](#toc_3)\n\nFeeling Overwhelmed and Not Sure Where to Start?\n\nWe feel you! Staying clear of spam filters can be pretty daunting. If you're short on time and want a quick summary, hop into our [email deliverability checklist](https://21165194.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21165194/Checklists_Apollo%E2%80%99s%20Cold%20Email%20Deliverability%20Checklist.pdf) and follow the best practices to improve your email deliverability rates.\n\nAt a high level, there are 2 primary causes for email bounces and ESPs marking emails as spam:\n\n1.  Domain reputation\n2.  Email content and formatting\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Domain Reputation[](#toc_4)\n\nFor a better chance of avoiding spam filters, follow the steps below to configure your domain settings.\n\n#### Set Up the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for Your Sending Domains[](#toc_5)\n\nWelcome-listing your domain improves your deliverability and ISP reputation. You should configure the following domain attributes to help raise your spam score.\n\n*   [Set Up SPF Records](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046457454861-Set-Up-Sender-Policy-Framework-SPF-Records-to-Authorize-Your-Emails): An authorization method that specifies which email servers can send and receive emails on behalf of your organization.\n*   [Set Up DKIM Policies](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046544644365-Set-Up-Domain-Keys-Identified-Mail-DKIM-to-Authenticate-Your-Email): An authentication method that uses cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt emails sent to and from your organization. It also prevents in-transit altering of sent or received messages.\n*   [Set Up DMARC Policies](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046576375437): An authentication method that specifies how to handle emails that don't pass SPF and/or DKIM checks. DMARC also generates reports to prevent email spoofing.\n\nMaster of Your Domain (Providers)\n\nThe information you need to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM is specifically related to your domain and is not related to Apollo. Apollo doesn't have email servers. All emails are sent directly from your email provider. Instructions to configure SPF, DMARC, and DKIM vary by domain provider. Contact your domain provider to obtain this information and receive any support you need.\n\nWhen you have configured SPF, DMARC, and DKIM, consider implementing the following:\n\n#### Set Up a New Domain[](#toc_6)\n\nThis domain should be different from your primary sending domain and you should only use it to send marketing emails. Additionally, this means you can create new mailboxes from this domain and add and replace them in Apollo for each user profile. For more information on how to connect mailboxes to Apollo, refer to the [Link Your Mailbox to Apollo.io](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093) article.\n\n#### Set Up a New Tracking Domain[](#toc_7)\n\nA tracking domain is a secondary (or sub) domain name related to your original domain. It allows Apollo to redirect a tracking pixel added to emails to track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.\n\nTracking pixels are often flagged as spam. Tracking domains redirect the attention of the email from your main domain and will help with deliverability.\n\nFollow [these instructions](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415240542733-Set-Up-a-Custom-Tracking-Subdomain-URL-) to set up a new [tracking subdomain](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/tracking-subdomains).\n\nTighten Up Tracking Domains\n\nOn occasion, you may find that a server flags your domain as spam. If this happens, you can spin up a new one with the tracking subdomain. Make sure you follow the same instructions to create a new [tracking subdomain](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415240542733-Set-Up-a-Custom-Tracking-Subdomain-URL-) with a different name to reset your deliverability if needed.\n\n### Email Content and Formatting[](#toc_8)\n\n*   **Remove Links from the Body of Your Email**: Spam filters look for links, especially in first-contact emails. Ensure you've removed links from your signature and in the body of your emails.\n    \n*   **Remove Images from the Body of Your Email**: Images or attachments, especially in automated or first-contact emails, can activate spam blockers and cause bounces. Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for step 3 or later in sequences once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\n    \n*   **Don't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text**: Spam blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\n    \n*   **Keep Your Paragraphs Concise**: Lengthy content can activate spam blockers or cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\n    \n*   **Avoid Words that Trigger Spam Filters**: Spam filters are constantly evolving. As a result, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. Try to communicate in a professional, personable way. Avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself. For further recommendations, refer to [Avoid Spam Triggers in Your Email Content](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415045401485-How-Do-I-Write-Effective-Sales-Emails-#toc_9).\n    \n*   **A/B Test Your Messaging**: Always test your messaging to see what works best. You can [A/B test in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597-Add-an-A-B-Test-to-an-Email-Step-in-a-Sequence) to try multiple versions of a message. If one version has a higher bounce rate, compare the differences to understand the cause.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Additional Considerations[](#toc_9)\n\nStill having issues with spam-blocked emails? Here are some additional steps you can take:\n\n*   **Connect Apollo to a SendGrid or Mailgun Account**: SendGrid and Mailgun are mass emailing services that use their own email servers. They also replace the tracking URLs and direct them to their servers to resolve deliverability issues. If you already use SendGrid or Mailgun, you can integrate your account with Apollo. If you do so, you do not need to configure a tracking subdomain. SendGrid and Mailgun manage your tracking links on their end.\n    \n    For Old-Timers Only!\n    \n    Please note, Apollo only recommends integrating with your SendGrid or Mailgun account if you already actively use their platform for transactional or marketing emails related to your service or product. If you don't, consider using [this Apollo partner](https://agencies.apollo.io/partners/senders) to help you follow deliverability best practices.\n    \n    Click [here](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414449230093) for more info on the SendGrid integration or [here](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8688131737229-Integrate-Mailgun-with-Apollo) for more on the Mailgun integration.\n    \n    There Can Only Be One (Tracking Link)\n    \n    If you've connected your Apollo account to SendGrid or Mailgun and your emails are flagged as spam, you may need to replace the tracking link within your SendGrid or Mailgun account. Both platforms provide a feature that functions like Apollo's tracking subdomain. For more info and support on deliverability with your SendGrid or Mailgun account, refer to [this help article](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding#what-is-link-branding) for SendGrid or [this support article](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding#what-is-link-branding) for Mailgun.\n    \n\n*   **Include\u00a0an Unsubscribe Link\u00a0in Your Email Signature**: Customize the text in an opt-out link from your [email settings](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account). Apollo then automatically adds the link with your signature on all of the emails you send via mailboxes connected to Apollo. Recipients are more likely to click an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as spam. When a recipient unsubscribes, it does not affect your overall sending reputation. If they mark you as spam, it does. For more info on how to configure your unsubscribe link, refer to [this article](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140379661-Configure-Your-Opt-Out-Unsubscribe-Email-Link).\n\n*   **Update Apollo Send Limits**: Head to **Settings**, click **You**, and then click the [**Mailboxes**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account/mailboxes) tab. Click a mailbox and consider lowering the sending limits to 50 emails per day with a delay of 90s between each email. For more info, refer to the [Email Sending Limits Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005-Email-Sending-Limits-Overview) article. Want to follow best practices but need to send more emails? You can [**link more mailboxes**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io) to send a higher volume of emails without putting your domain at risk. [![Send Limits](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_spam_filters/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_spam_filters/i1.png)\n\n*   **Only Send Messages to Contacts with Verified Emails**: Use the [email status filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423314404621-Email-Status-Overview) and the [date refreshed in Apollo filter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur1X4mLDFf4&t=642s) when prospecting. You should only add contacts with valid, up-to-date emails into your sequences.\n    \n    Stop, in the Name of Accuracy!\n    \n    If a contact with a [verified email](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423314404621-Email-Status-Overview) spam blocks you, it doesn't mean the email address is inaccurate. It means the contact likely exists and your email was either automatically or manually marked as unfit or inappropriate for delivery.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\nJoin Us in Our Sales Community!\n\nAre you a diehard Apollo fan who\u2019s passionate about sharing and learning industry-leading sales tactics from members of our sales community?

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nBuying intent helps you engage with the right prospects from the right companies at the right time. With timely insights into the online intent-to-buy behaviors of your ideal customer profiles, buying intent allows you to easily identify the solutions and products that your target markets are actively researching online.\n\nOnce you have identified your ideal customer profiles in Apollo, you can use buying intent to visualize key online behavior, filter by the ideal companies with the highest intent scores for your selected topics, and prioritize your pipeline accordingly.\n\nPlan Your Topics and Filters\n\nYour access to buying intent topics and search filters depends on your Apollo plan. Refer to [Apollo's pricing page](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) for more details.\n\nThe following sections details how Apollo calculates and sources buying intent, and the different intent topics available to you.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand Intent Signals[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo partners with buying intent data providers Bombora and LeadSift (a Foundry company) to provide buying intent signals. For more information about how these Apollo partners collect intent data, please refer to Bombora's [intent data overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9296665299213) and Foundry's[intent data product information](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9296665299213).\n\nTo utilize buying intent signals in Apollo, you must first select [intent topics](#select-intent-topics). These are the different keywords and competitors that you are targeting. When a company actively searches for 1 of your selected intent topics, this triggers an intent signal. Apollo captures and updates intent signals weekly. Based on the frequency, trend, and recency that these intent signals fire, Apollo calculates [intent score](#intent-scores) for companies.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Intent Topics[](#toc_3)\n\nIntent topics are products and services that prospects actively research online across social media, company websites, job boards, news sites, and other sources. It can be a keyword or even competitor names.\n\nIn Apollo, you can choose from over 14,000 intent topics from Bombora, and over 1,600 intent topics from LeadSift within 110 broader categories such as 3D software, sales, and financial services. Refer to [Intent Topics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9296665299213) for a complete list of available topics.\n\nYou can find powerful granularity when searching at the intent topic level in Apollo. This means that you can apply the specific intent topics that best fit your market, even if it is very niche.\n\nFor example, if you are in the development tools industry, you could apply something granular to your search such as \"artificial neural network software,\" \"cookie and website tracker scanning software,\" or \"augmented reality SDK software,\" to name just a few of your available options.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Intent Scores[](#toc_4)\n\nApollo uses data from Bombora and LeadSift to calculate intent scores. This score indicates the strength of a company's buying intent. A higher intent score indicates a contact is more likely to engage with your company and convert into paying customers.\n\nWhen Bombora provides an intent topic, Apollo utilizes the accompanying intent score that is placed in a range of 0-100. Apollo considers scores from 0-61 to be low, 62-75 to be mid, and 75-100 to be high.\n\nWhen LeadSift provides an intent topics, Apollo's proprietary algorithm calculates intent scores based on the following components:\n\n*   **Frequency**: How often is a company searching for a particular topic with intent? For example, a company triggers 3 signals within the last 3 months.\n*   **Trend**: Has there been an upward or downward trend in the search for a particular intent topic over the last 30 days in comparison to the previous 30 days?\n*   **Recency**: When was the last time a company searched for the intent topic? For example, the intent score could be different if the most recent search was 1 week ago or 1 month ago.\n\nApollo considers each of these components when giving the company a score based on LeadSift's data, and then groups the scores into the following categories:\n\n*   **High**: A company triggers at least 4 intent signals in the last 90 days or demonstrates an upward trend with at least 2 intent signals in the last week.\n*   **Medium**: A company triggers at least 2 intent signals in the last 90 days and at least 1 intent signal in the last 2 weeks.\n*   **Low**: A company triggers at least 1 intent signal in the last 90 days.\n\nIf both Bombora and LeadSift provide data for an intent topic, Apollo chooses the higher score between the 2 sources.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Use Buying Intent[](#toc_5)\n\nReady to leverage buying intent?

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nThe website visitors feature enables you to track the accounts that have visited your websites. This means you can uncover the names of companies that have generated activity on the domains you choose to track and filter them based on when they visited and how engaged they are in the buying process.\n\nUsing Apollo to track your website visitors reduces the need for your sales team to coordinate with your own IT and marketing teams to understand whether prospects are actively engaged with your websites. You can also use [more search filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661) to further reduce the noise in your visitors data and target only your ideal prospects based on company information.\n\nRefer to the following sections to learn how to track your websites' visitors and view the related data in Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Set Up Tracking[](#toc_1)\n\n### Step 0: Before You Begin[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo admins can complete the instructions provided in [step 1](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20544185285389#toc_3) and [step 3](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20544185285389#toc_5) of this article. Technical skills are not required.\n\nThe instructions in [step 2](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20544185285389#toc_4) require either knowledge of HTML and a front-end language like JavaScript, along with access to your website's codebase, or access to a tool such as Google Tag Manager. If you or your team do not have access or the technical skills needed, work with your organization to arrange the necessary help.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Step 1: Add Website Domains[](#toc_3)\n\nTo add the websites that you want to track and find the Apollo JavaScript snippet:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** > **Prospecting** > [**Website visitors**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/websites).\n2.  Click **Add Domain**. [![Add a domain to track.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_first_party_intent_data/i51.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_first_party_intent_data/i51.png)\n3.  Enter the URL for the website where you want to track traffic.\n    \n    (Optional) For the domain you added, open the **Advanced Intent Settings** drop-down to set the scoring criteria for your website visitors. Your scoring criteria establishes how important visits to specific website pages are to you, and helps you identify accounts showing a strong interest in your product when \\[viewing your website visitor data\\](#view-your-website-visitor-data).\n    \n    For example, if you believe that visits to your pricing page represent a strong interest in your product, you might want to set **Page URL** to your pricing page's URL and **Intent** to `High`. [![Enter domain details and intent scoring.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_first_party_intent_data/i28.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_first_party_intent_data/i28.png)\n    \n4.

Enforce a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and/or non-alphanumeric characters.\n*   **Password length**: Set a minimum character length to increase password strength. You can choose anywhere between 10 and 100 characters.\n*   **Password expiration**: Define the number of days a user's password can remain valid before they must change it. Select a period between 10 and 365 days.\n*   **Password reuse**: Prevent your team from using the same password twice.

This means they must periodically re-enter their password to get back into your Apollo instance. You can choose a session timeout period of between 1 and 30 days.\n*   **Failed login settings**: Choose the number of failed login attempts a user can make within a 24-hour period. You can set the cap at anywhere between 3 and 10 attempts. If a user fails to enter the correct credentials within the given limit you set, Apollo temporarily disables their access and sends password reset instructions via email.\n\nTo access the settings for login controls:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**Security**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/security/login-controls).\n2.

Currently, Nylas Mail supports:\n\n*   Microsoft Exchange\n*   Office 365\n*   Outlook\n*   Yahoo!\n*   Custom email accounts/servers\n\nPOP/POP3 Mailboxes Are Not Supported\n\nNylas Mail, Apollo's third-party provider for non-Gmail email syncs, does not support connecting to mailbox accounts via\u00a0POP/POP3. The vast majority of\u00a0mail providers who support POP3 also support the IMAP standard and can connect to Apollo that way. Nylas Mail also supports the SMTP standard.\n\nNylas does not currently support Titan email servers or large transactional sending services like Mandrill or Amazon SES. For that reason, Apollo cannot support linking to those services through Nylas.\n\nHigh-Volume Emails\n\nIf you need to send larger-volume emails than Apollo's recommended safe sending limits, you should integrate your linked mailbox, whether it is Gmail, Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, Outlook, Yahoo!, or a custom email account, with Sendgrid.

If a **contact** attempts to click the link after 47 days, the URL will not be valid.\n\nYou have now enabled an opt-out message and unsubscribe link that Apollo automatically includes below your [email signature](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140295949-Set-Up-Your-Email-Signature) in every email you send to contacts via your Apollo sequences.\n\nOther Unsubscribe Options\n\nIf you prefer to keep this option disabled, you can also place an unsubscribe link in your signature or the body of an [email template](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409238165389-Create-and-Edit-Email-Templates). Just make sure you include the `{{opt_out_message}}` [dynamic variable](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813-Use-Basic-Dynamic-Variables) wherever you put it.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Visualize the Unsubscribe Workflow for Recipients[](#toc_4)\n\nWhen recipients click an unsubscribe link in your emails, Apollo directs them to an unsubscribe landing page.

Apollo then automatically removes the recipient from future steps in any sequences you've added them to. If you try to enroll a contact into a sequence after they unsubscribe, Apollo warns you that the contact has opted out of receiving your emails and prevents you from adding them to the sequence.\n\nRecipients also have the chance to resubscribe from the landing page.\n\n[![Unsubscribe feedback](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/configure_your_opt_out_unsubscribe_email_link/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/configure_your_opt_out_unsubscribe_email_link/i8.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Include One-Click Unsubscribe Headers in Your Emails[](#toc_5)\n\nTo prevent mailbox providers like Gmail from treating your emails as spam, Apollo strongly recommends you enable one-click unsubscribe headers in all emails you send via the mailboxes you've connected to Apollo. This makes it easy for a recipient to opt out if they no longer want to receive your messages. It also ensures you remain compliant with [Google and Yahoo's email policies](https://www.apollo.io/magazine/what-mailbox-providers-new-spam-rules-mean-for-your-sales-organization) if you send large volumes of emails as part of your [sales outreach strategy](https://www.apollo.io/academy/5-best-sales-sequences).\n\nTop Deliverability Tips\n\nPlease note, this feature is currently only available for Gmail, SendGrid, and Mailgun users.\n\nAs a best practice, Apollo still recommends that you include an unsubscribe link in your signature or the body of your email as well as in the email header.\n\nTo turn on one-click unsubscribe headers in Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Settings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account) > **You**.\n2.  From the **General** tab, enable the one-click unsubscribe headers toggle in the **Email Settings** section of the **General** tab.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nSet up look-alike domains to protect your primary domain and improve email deliverability when you reach out to contacts via [Apollo sequences](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n\nA look-alike, or cousin, domain is not the same as your company's primary operating domain. Automated systems do not see it as a match. Nonetheless, it is a domain that most casual observers affiliate with your primary domain. For example, if `apollo.io` is Apollo's primary domain, Apollo might choose to create a cousin domain like `heyapollo.io` or `meetapollo.io`.\n\nWhen you send cold emails from a look-alike domain, you help protect the sending reputation of your primary domain and eradicate the risk of negatively impacting the deliverability of your company's regular operational email.\n\nRefer to the following sections for the recommended steps when setting up look-alike domains for your cold outreach in Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Set Up a New Domain[](#toc_2)\n\nTo set up a new look-alike domain:\n\n1.  **Set up a new domain with your domain provider**:  \n    Every domain provider has a different domain management interface. If you need help setting up a new domain, visit your domain provider's knowledge base.\n    \n    Here are some popular domain provider resources for guidance:\n    \n    *   [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/domain-create.html)\n    *   [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/domains-1000003)\n    *   [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/category/34/domains/)\n2.  **Create a new email address**: When you have set up a new domain, you need to create a professional email address with your mailbox provider (MBP) using your new domain. For further guidance, please refer to your MBP's knowledge base.\n    \n    Here are some popular MBP help centers for support:\n    \n    *   [Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us)\n    *   [Google Workspace](https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/)\n3.  **Finalize the setup**: Head to your domain provider and configure the settings to finalize the setup process.\n\nNow that you have a new look-alike domain, follow [best practices](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/25265069912717-Set-up-Lookalike-Domains-to-Protect-Your-Primary-Domain#toc_3) to set your team up for success.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Follow Setup Best Practices[](#toc_3)\n\nBefore you link your mailbox to Apollo and begin your cold outreach, there are certain best practices to follow. Although a look-alike domain isolates your primary domain from the damage that poor targeting, content, and sending practices can have on your sending reputation, you should still follow best practices with your look-alike domain. It takes very little time to burn a sending reputation, and recovering or rebuilding it on another domain is a slow process.\n\nTo protect the reputation of your look-alike domain and optimize your sending efforts:\n\n1.  **Do not use more domains than necessary**:  \n    When an MBP sees the same message coming from many different domains, it looks like [snowshoe spamming](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1713/snowshoe-spamming). This is where a spammer spreads sends across multiple domains and IPs to avoid being caught.\n2.  **Allow your new domain to age**:  \n    Spammers often register new domains and immediately start spamming through them. Almost all filtering systems will flag a domain as potential spam if it is less than a month old. Wait 30 days before you send any emails from this domain, and then begin sending emails slowly. Start by sending 10 emails daily and monitor [open](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410838798349-Open-Tracking-Overview) and [click](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409803614093-Click-Tracking-in-Apollo) rates. After a few weeks, if your emails are performing well, slowly increase the number of emails you send. Remember not to exceed Apollo's [recommended sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005-Email-Sending-Limits-Overview#toc_6) per mailbox.\n3.  **Publish a website on your domain**:  \n    A simple landing page will suffice. Filters do automated vetting on a domain, including looking for a website.  \n    \n    Play It Safe\n    \n    Please note, Apollo recommends that you don't forward traffic from your landing page to your main corporate site. You should also avoid including links or images that direct users back to your main domain. These tactics tie your domain reputations together and counteract the purpose of creating a look-alike domain for your cold outreach efforts.\n    \n4.  **Avoid using DNS privacy**:  \n    It's common spammer practice to hide behind anonymized registrars. As a result, if you register your domain with anonymized contact information, servers are more likely to treat you as a spammer.\n5.  **Follow domain authentication best practices:**  \n    *   Whitelabel everything to ensure all URLs in your messages and on your landing page link back to the look-alike domain and not your main domain.\n    *   Use a custom tracking link at the domain.\n    *   Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for the domain and ensure all links run through it.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 3: Link Your New Mailbox to Apollo[](#toc_4)\n\nWhen you've set up your new look-alike domain, [link the associated mailboxes to Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io) and follow the mailbox configuration steps.\n\n[![View all search filters.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_lookalike_domains/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_lookalike_domains/i1.png)\n\nWhen you link the mailbox(es), make sure you configure:\n\n*   [Your email signature](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140295949-Set-Up-Your-Email-Signature).\n*   [Sending limits](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233349005-Email-Sending-Limits-Overview).\n*   [Opt-out](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140379661-Configure-Your-Unsubscribe-Email-Link) and [open tracking](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410838798349-Open-Tracking-Overview).\n*   [Domain authentication](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-Spam-Filters#toc_5).\n\nNow you're ready to [create](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101-Create-a-Sequence) and [enroll contacts](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence) into your Apollo sequences. Just make sure you adhere to the following [best sending practices](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/25265069912717-Set-up-Lookalike-Domains-to-Protect-Your-Primary-Domain#toc_5) when you do so.\n\n[Back to top](#top)\n\n## Step 4: Follow Sending Best Practices[](#toc_5)\n\nWhen you build your sequences in Apollo, follow best sending practices to optimize your campaigns for engagement.\n\n1.  **Don't link back to your primary domain from within your emails**:  \n    Avoid linking to or including images hosted at your main corporate site. You must isolate the reputation of the look-alike domain from your primary domain. You don\u2019t want automated link followers to add your main corporate domain to the reputation that the sends from your look-alike domain generate.\n2.  **Use different email templates for each domain**:  \n    If you set up several look-alike domains and use the exact same messaging across each one, you risk aggregating your sending reputation across domains. This is because servers apply fingerprinting tactics to evaluate how recipients treat your messages. Data points include your domain and IP, the URLs in your messages, and the general structure of the messages you send. When you send the same message across multiple domains, you also risk being flagged for snowshoe spamming.\n3.  **Avoid \"batch and blast\" messages**:  \n    Optimizing for engagement is key. Follow [email best practices](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415045401485-How-Do-I-Write-Effective-Sales-Emails) and avoid [the common mistakes of inauthentic personalization](https://www.apollo.io/academy/how-to-write-cold-emails-anyone-will-respond-to?videoId=wx04ee9o8d). Resist the temptation of gathering a large list and bulk-sending all your contacts the same generic message. Instead, focus on clearly identifying your [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416471135245-Identify-Your-Ideal-Customer-Profile-ICP), using [search filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview) to segment your contacts, and enrolling them into sequences with highly targeted messaging that speaks to their specific goals and needs.\n4.  **Auto-assign emails in a sequence to increase your daily reach**:  \n    When you [add contacts to a sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence#toc_3), select the auto-assign email toggle to rotate between the mailboxes you use to send your emails. [![View all search filters.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_lookalike_domains/i2.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_lookalike_domains/i2.png)Apollo then dynamically manages which email you send a message from based on the sending limits and availability of the selected mailboxes at the time of sending.\n    \n    Don't Mix and Match!\n    \n    For each sequence, you should only select mailboxes from the same look-alike domain to avoid aggregating sending reputation across your domains.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/25265069912717-Set-up-Look-alike-Domains-to-Protect-Your-Primary-Domain"}

There is no limit to how many you can create.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Search Using Territories[](#toc_3)\n\nWhen you assign territories to users in your Apollo account, they cannot see, search, or access any contacts that fall outside the rules of those territories.\n\nWhen a user searches for new contacts or accounts in Apollo, the **Territories** search filter shows the territory you've assigned to them. Only Apollo admins can edit or delete this filter.\n\n[![View assigned territory.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i40.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i40.png)\n\nContact Restrictions\n\nIf users search for a particular record in Apollo and can't see it, it's most likely because a territory restricts their view. To give them access to additional contacts that fall outside of their territory, you can either [edit the rules for the territories](#toc_7) assigned to them, or [update their permission profile](#toc_6).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Restrict Prospecting by Account Owner Status[](#toc_4)\n\nIf you only want users at your company to prospect contacts from accounts they have been assigned, restrict their prospecting activities using territories. As an Apollo admin, build a territory that automatically applies to all of your assigned users and restricts their search in Apollo to the accounts they own, rather than building separate territories for each individual user.\n\nStart by [adding a new territory](#toc_2) and assigning it to a user group. When you select filters for the territory, click the **Owner** filter. Then, select `Current User` from the **Account owner** drop-down.\n\n[![View assigned territory.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i45.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i45.png)\n\nWhen users with the [assigned territory search for contacts](#toc_3), they will only see contacts from their own accounts.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Restrict Prospecting Using Custom Fields[](#toc_5)\n\nIf you assign account owners in Salesforce or HubSpot and sync that data to Apollo, use custom field entries to restrict prospecting activities by territory. This ensures users only prospect the accounts in Apollo that you have assigned to them in your CRM.\n\nCreate a Lookup - User Field\n\nStart by [adding a new territory](#toc_2) and assigning it to a user group. When you select filters for the territory:\n\n1.  Click the **Custom Fields** filter and then click the **Contact** tab. Select **Add Custom Field Filter** and choose a custom field.

Click **Save filters** and finish creating the territory.\n\nYou have now restricted prospecting with custom fields. When users with the [assigned territory search for contacts](#toc_3), they will only see the records where the custom field you selected has a value that matches the user.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Edit Permission Profiles for Territories (Admins Only)[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you are an Apollo admin, you can edit permission profiles to add or remove user territory permissions. This enables you to control which users at your company can add new territories and prospect outside of their assigned territories.\n\nTo edit permission profiles, launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**Permission Profiles**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/permissions-profiles). Then, follow the steps in [Create and Assign Permission Profiles](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409154208269).\n\nIn the **Prospecting** permissions section, click the following checkboxes to give users more flexibility when prospecting:\n\n*   **Can add or edit Territories & Territory Rules**: This enables users to add and edit territories.\n*   **Can prospect outside of assigned territories**: This enables users to search for new contacts and accounts outside their assigned territories.\n\n[![Apply territories permissions to your Apollo users.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i41.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/add_edit_and_prospect_with_territories/i41.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Edit Existing Territories[](#toc_7)\n\nTo edit an existing territory:\n\n1.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nYou may want to upload a CSV file of contacts to Apollo if:\n\n*   You don't have a CRM or haven't [connected your CRM with Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725).\n*   You have a list of contacts that you want to engage with and track in Apollo.\n*   You have contacts that you want to add to a list in Apollo\n*   You have contacts you want to save in Apollo first and then enrich with verified emails or phone numbers.\n\nEnrichment and Uploads Go Head-to-Head!\n\nPondering the difference between enriching a CSV file and uploading one? Let's take a closer look at both:\n\n*   **CSV Uploads**: Use this feature to save your contacts in Apollo and then take action on them, such as enroll them in [a sequence](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences), call them from [the dialer](https://app.apollo.io/#/phone-calls), add them to an [Apollo list](https://app.apollo.io/#/people/tags), leverage [conversation insights](https://app.apollo.io/#/conversations) from any meetings you have with them, [track your engagement](https://app.apollo.io/#/analytics) with them through Apollo, and much more. When you upload your CSV file, Apollo matches the contact and enriches the record with missing data. Apollo does not enrich email or phone number fields when you upload a CSV file.\n*   [**CSV Enrichment**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226361229-Improve-Your-CSV-Data-With-CSV-Enrichment): Use this feature to improve the overall data of the records in your CSV. You can choose from over 38 data points with which to enrich your records and then export the enriched CSV file. You can also choose to use credits to enrich the contacts' email and phone numbers if you want to. This feature does not save contacts to the Apollo database.\n\nRefer to the following sections for more information on how to correctly prepare your CSV, upload it into Apollo, and then apply the CSV to a search and engage or enrich the contacts with verified emails and phone numbers.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 0: Prepare Your CSV File[](#toc_2)\n\nBefore you import a CSV of contacts into Apollo:\n\n1.  Make sure your file includes the following mandatory columns:\n    \n    *   First Name\n    *   Last Name\n    *   Company\n    *   Company Website\n    \n    However, the more data you include in your CSV, the better. Apollo can then match the contact in the database and enrich the record with any missing information found. To further improve your chances of a match, Apollo recommends you include the contact email and/or LinkedIn profile if you have it.\n    \n    Only Have LinkedIn Data?\n    \n    Please note, if you only have the URL to a contact's LinkedIn profile, Apollo doesn't recommend you import this data from a CSV. Instead, you can use the Apollo Chrome Extension to save the contact directly from their LinkedIn profile. For more information, please refer to the [Apollo Chrome Extension Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226637453-Apollo-Chrome-Extension-Overview) article.\n    \n2.  Check that you have set the language settings in your PC to one of the following supported delimiters:\n    \n    *   Comma (,)\n    *   Semicolon (;)\n    *   Colon (:)\n    *   Pipe (|)\n    \n    If you encounter any formatting issues when you upload your file, you likely need to change your default settings.

Make sure you convert your file to CSV format. Apollo does not currently support TSV files.\n\nSpecial CSV Column Circumstances\n\nIf your CSV file includes values that you want to map to a checkbox in Apollo, enter `True` for checked and `False` for unchecked.\n\nIf your CSV file includes a column featuring a multi-picklist field, you should separate each value in the cell with a semicolon.\n\n[![Special CSV Column Circumstances](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i8.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Upload a CSV of Contacts[](#toc_3)\n\nTo upload a CSV file of contacts into Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and then click **Search** > [**People**](https://app.apollo.io/#/people/).\n2.  Click **Import** > **Bulk Import from CSV**. [![Bulk Import](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i4.png)\n3.

So sit back, take a deep breath, and make sure you map correctly. And remember, you can only map one Apollo field to one column header. No more, no less. After all, nobody likes a data pickle!\n\nTo map your CSV column headers to the corresponding Apollo fields:\n\n1.  Use the drop-down menus for each unmapped column and select the Apollo field. [![Mapping](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i7.png)\n2.  (Recommended) If you don't see the correct Apollo field for a column header in your CSV, you'll need to create a custom field before you can map it.  \n    To create a custom field:\n    \n    Curious About Custom Fields?\n    \n    For more information on all things custom contact fields, sneak a peek at the [Create Custom Contact Fields](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412498825869-Create-Custom-Contact-Fields) article.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 3: Configure the Settings and Import Your CSV[](#toc_5)\n\nNow that you've mapped your fields, it's time to configure the settings and import your CSV.\n\nTo finalize the CSV upload:\n\n1.  Scroll to **Settings** and click the **What stage would you like to set the contacts to?** drop-down. Then, choose the contact stage that best represents the engagement status for all of the contacts in the CSV. [![Stage](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i9.png)\n    \n    Why does \"Contact Stage\" matter?\n    \n    It's important to set your CSV list to [the correct stage](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410623601165-Contact-and-Account-Stages-Overview), especially if you plan to enroll the contacts in [an Apollo sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview). That way, you can efficiently tailor your messaging according to their stage in your sales pipeline.\n    \n2.  Click the **If contacts already exist in Apollo** drop-down to choose whether to skip or update any contacts you've already saved in Apollo. [![Existing Behavior](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i10.png)\n    \n    What criteria does Apollo use to match existing contacts in Apollo to contacts in a CSV file?\n    \n    If you choose to update existing records in Apollo with the data in your CSV, Apollo uses 3 sets of unique identifiers in order of most to least unique. Those identifiers include:\n    \n    *   `linkedin_URL`\n    *   `first_name` + `last_name` + `organization`\n    *   `email address`\n    \n    This means that if you include `linkedin_URL`, you can update all of the other data for a person. If you include\u00a0`first_name` + `last_name` + `organization`, but you do not include a different `linkedin_URL`, you can update `email address` and other data. If you include only `email_address` and you do not include the\u00a0`linkedin_URL` or `first_name` + `last_name` + `organization`, then you can only update other fields for the people in your file.\n    \n    If you opt to update existing records in Apollo from your CSV, Apollo only updates records that have a matching email address, a matching name (first and last), and a matching company.\n    \n    When duplicate people exist in your CSV, Apollo only accepts the highest row in the file to update the record in the platform.\n    \n3.  Click the **If owner value is missing in your CSV, assign owner to** drop-down to decide which user you want to own any imported contacts without a specified owner. [![Set Record Owner](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i11.png)\n4.  Click the **If existing contacts already have owner** drop-down to choose whether or not you want to override an existing owner in Apollo with the one specified in your CSV.

Select an option from the **Auto-assign accounts?** drop-down to determine whether or not Apollo should assign accounts based on the website or email domain for the contacts in your CSV. [![Auto-Assign](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i13.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i13.png)\n    \n    Calling All Salesforce Users!\n    \n    If you've integrated Salesforce with Apollo, you can also decide whether or not Apollo should create and update records in Salesforce based on the uploaded CSV.\n    \n    [![Accounts With Salesforce Integrated](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i14.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i14.png)\n    \n6.  (Optional) Click the **Add to a List?** drop-down to select an existing list or create a new one. When you import your CSV, Apollo adds the contacts from your file to a list in Apollo. [![Add To List](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/upload_a_csv_of_contacts_to_apollo/i15.png)\n7.

There are 3 different types of meetings that you can create:\n\n*   **Single-host**: This meeting type only ever has one host. Single-host meetings should be used for one-on-one discussions with your prospect.\n*   **Multi-host**: This meeting type has multiple hosts that co-host the meeting. When a prospect schedules a meeting of this type, all hosts must be available at the same time for the calendar slot to be available.\n*   **Round robin host**: This meeting type rotates between different hosts each time it is used to schedule a meeting. Round-robin meetings should also be used for one-on-one discussions. You can choose to rotate hosts based on either the availability of hosts for certain time slots or the equal distribution of hosts so that each host is booked as part of a rotation one by one.\n\nDifferent Plan, Different Possibilities\n\nIf you are on a free Apollo plan, you can activate up to 6 meeting types at a time.\n\nHowever, if you are on a paid plan, the world is your oyster!

To learn about the small differences when creating those meeting types, refer to the [Create Multi-Host and Round Robin Host Meeting Types](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173#toc_8) section of this article.\n\nTo create a new single-host meeting type:\n\nLaunch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types). Click **Create**, then choose the **Single-host** option.\n\n[![Create New Meeting Type](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i6.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Step 2: Add the Meeting Type Details[](#toc_3)\n\nFirst, name your meeting type. This will make it easier for your prospects to identify if they are booking the right type of meeting.\n\n[![Meeting Type Name Text-Box](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i44.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i44.png)\n\nThen, click 1 of the **Meeting duration** options to specify how long you want this type of meeting to last.\n\n[![Duration Radio Button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i45.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i45.png)\n\nTo personalize the link for this meeting type, edit the text in the **Meeting link** text box. Click the **Copy** icon on the right to copy the link.\n\n[![Edit and Copy Link in Meeting Link Text-Box](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i46.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i46.png)\n\nIt Can Always Wait!\n\nIf you are not ready to copy the link right away, fear not! When you finish creating the new meeting type, you can access and copy the link from the **Meeting Types** tab at any time.\n\n[![Copy Link Button in Meeting Type Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i5.png)\n\nClick the meeting location drop-down and choose which video conference platform will host your meetings: **Google Meet**, **Zoom**, or a **Custom meeting link**.\n\n[![Video Conference Link Text Box](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i47.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i47.png)\n\nAdd a description in the **Meeting Description** text box to give guests more context about the purpose of this meeting type.\n\n[![Description Text Box](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i48.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i48.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Step 3: Set Your Availability[](#toc_4)\n\nNow you are ready to set your availability for this meeting type.\n\nApollo automatically adds your default timezone to this meeting type. If you want to make any changes, click the **Current timezone** drop-down on the right and select the timezone of your choice.\n\n[![Time-Zone Drop-Down on Create New Meeting Type Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i49.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i49.png)\n\nClick the checkboxes next to the days you want to appear available to guests for this type of meeting. Then, set your open time slots using the drop-down options on the right of each day.\n\n[![Open Time Slots Section of Create New Meeting Type Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i50.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i50.png)\n\nAs Easy As Pie\n\nApollo displays the default time slots you configured in the settings during the initial set-up. Only follow the steps to change your open time slots if you want to customize your availability for this specific meeting type.\n\nClick the **+** button on the right to create additional time slots per day. Then, use the drop-down to amend the times according to your availability. You can add as many extra time slots per day as you like.\n\n[![+ Button on Right of Time Slots](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i51.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i51.png)\n\nIf you want to replicate your availability for other days of the week, click the **Copy** icon. Then, click the checkbox next to the days for which you want to enable the same open time slots. When ready, click **Apply**.\n\n[![Copy Open Time Slots Icon](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i52.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i52.png)\n\nClick the **trash can** icon to delete an additional time slot.\n\n[![Trash Can Icon on the Right of Time Slot](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i53.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i53.png)\n\nNext, set your meeting buffers. This option ensures that you cannot be booked for a certain amount of time you set before and/or after a meeting.\n\n[![Set your meeting buffers.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i54.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i54.png)\n\nSet a minimum schedule notice to prevent guests from scheduling last-minute meetings with you. Set a maximum number of meetings to prevent overbooking your calendar during certain periods.\n\n[![Minimum Schedule Notice Field](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i55.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i5.png)\n\nYou can also set a maximum date range to ensure your guests don't schedule time with you too far into the future.\n\n[![Maximum Date Range Field](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i56.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i56.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Step 4: Choose Your Intake Form Questions[](#toc_5)\n\nBy default, your intake form requires prospects to enter their name and email address. You cannot edit or remove these fields from your form.\n\nTo add more questions to your form:\n\nClick **Add a question**.\n\n[![Add a new question.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i57.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i57.png)\n\nChoose from standard options such as company size and phone number, or create a custom question with your own input types.\n\n[![Choose your question.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i31.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i31.png)\n\nIf you choose **Single-select** or **Multi-select** as your input type for a custom question, you need to provide answers that the prospects can select.\n\n[![Provide answers for certain question types.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i58.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i58.png)\n\nBy default, Apollo sets added questions as optional. This means that the prospect does not need to answer them to schedule a meeting. Click the **Set as required** checkbox if you want to make a question mandatory. Then, click **Save**.\n\n[![Make a question mandatory.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i59.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i59.png)\n\nTo sort your questions in a different order, drag and drop the question you want to move using the icon on the left side.\n\n[![Sort your questions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i60.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i60.png)\n\nTo edit a question, click the **pencil** icon on the right side of it. To delete the question from your form, click the **trash can** icon.\n\n[![Edit or delete an added question.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i61.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i61.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Step 5: Add an Email Reminder[](#toc_6)\n\nTo ensure that a prospect remembers to attend a meeting they booked with you, set up an automatic email reminder for them. You can skip this step if you prefer not to send a reminder.\n\nTo set up an email reminder:\n\nToggle the **Inactive** option to **Active**.\n\n[![Edit or delete an added question.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i62.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i62.png)\n\nYou can keep or edit the default email subject and text Apollo provides. To edit the text field, use the options along the edit bar at the bottom of the field. You can insert links, images, [dyanmic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813), and [snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093).\n\n[![Edit or delete an added question.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i63.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i63.png)\n\nTo preview your email, click the **eyeball** icon at the top left. If you want to preview the email in an inbox, click **Send test email to me**. Apollo then sends the preview to the default email inbox connected to your Apollo account.\n\n[![Preview your email reminder.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i64.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i64.png)\n\nIn the timing section, choose when you want to send your email reminder. If you want to send multiple reminders, click **Add timing**. You can add up to 3 reminders.\n\n[![Add an email reminder.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i66.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i66.png)\n\nWhen you have added all details for this single-host meeting type, click **Create meeting**.\n\n[![Finish creating your meeting type.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i67.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i67.png)\n\nYou have now created a new single-host meeting type.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Create Single-host Meeting Types for Other Users (Admins Only)[](#toc_7)\n\nIf you are an Apollo admin for your organization, you can create single-host meetings that other users host. This option enables you to apply standard templates to different types of meetings, such as demo meetings, and add or remove hosts as needed.\n\nThe steps you as an admin follow to create these meeting types are similar to [single-host meetings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173#toc_3). The most significant difference is that you need to choose the hosts for the meeting type.\n\nHost Your Own Meetings\n\nIf you are an Apollo admin and want to create a single-host meeting type that only you can use, only add yourself as a host when creating the meeting type.\n\nWhen choosing hosts, click **All hosts** to make the meeting type available to everyone, or click **Select individual hosts or teams** to add specific members of your organization as hosts.\n\n[![Choose the meeting hosts.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i20005.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i20005.png)\n\nYou also need to use an [intake form template](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_2) rather than adding intake form questions for a single meeting type.\n\nAs you create single-host meetings for your organization, you should educate potential meeting hosts on how to find and use these meeting types. To find these single-host meetings, users should launch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types). The admin-created meetings show a special icon in place of the activation slider.\n\n[![Find these meeting types.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i20006.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i20006.png)\n\nAs an admin, you can also add a link for the single-host meeting type to a [sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837) in Apollo that can be used by the hosts of the meeting. The link includes a [variable](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813) that populates information specific to each meeting host.\n\nTo copy this link, launch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types). Then, click **additional options** > **Copy Link** for the single-host meeting type that you created.\n\n[![Copy meeting type link.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i73.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i73.png)\n\nWhen you paste the link into an email within a sequence, the preview shows how the variable will populate for the hosts you assigned to the meeting type.\n\n[![Variable populates.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i74.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i74.png)\n\nTo manage the single-host meetings you create, launch Apollo and click **Meetings** > [**Admin console**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types). Then, access the **Team's Meeting** tab.\n\n[![Admin Console Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i20002.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i20002.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Create Multi-Host and Round Robin Host Meeting Types[](#toc_8)\n\nThe steps you follow to create these meeting types are similar to [single-host meetings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173#toc_3). There are currently a few slight differences:\n\nThe number of meeting types that you can create is also restricted if you are on a free Apollo plan:\n\n*   For free plans, individual users can create up to 6 single-host and multi-host meeting types. Also, teams can create up to 6 round-robin meeting types.\n*   For paid plans, you can create an unlimited number of meeting types.\n\nAll other steps are the same. Follow the instructions [**in the sections above**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173#toc_2) to create multi-host or round robin meeting types.\n\nInbound Routers Bring More than Meeting Routing\n\nApollo admins can add an intake form to the scheduling process for all meeting types by [creating an inbound router](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109)! This enables admins to add more questions to intake forms, and route prospects to different meeting types based on their answers.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Edit an Existing Meeting Type[](#toc_9)\n\nTo edit a meeting type:\n\nLaunch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types).

Click the **Meeting Types** tab. Then, click **Copy link** under the meeting type you want to share with a prospect.\n\n[![Copy Link Button in Meeting Type Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i5.png)\n\nYou have now copied the unique meeting schedule link for a specific meeting type.\n\n### Preview the Guest Scheduling Workflow[](#toc_11)\n\nTo gauge your guests' scheduling experience and ensure you have configured the details of each meeting type correctly, you can access a preview of the guest scheduling workflow.\n\nLaunch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types). Then, click **Preview** on the bottom-right of the meeting type you want to edit.\n\n[![Additional Options Button on Meeting Type Block](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i70.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/manage_your_meetings_in_apollo/i70.png)\n\nApollo directs you to the same scheduling process as the one prospects will follow for that meeting type.

Then, go to the **Reports** tab and click **Create report**.\n\nThere are 5 main configuration components of any custom report: metrics, dimensions, filters, visualization, and date range. The sections below outline how to configure each of these custom report components.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Configure Metrics[](#toc_3)\n\nFrom the new custom report, click the **Metrics** tab.\n\n[![Metrics](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i51.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i51.png)\n\nMetrics define what you want to measure. You can include as many metrics as you need in each custom report.\n\nApollo groups metrics into 9 top-level categories:\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Calls | Metrics related to the performance and status of calls made with the Apollo **Dialer** |\n| Emails | Metrics related to the performance of emails sent through sequences. |\n| Tasks | Metrics related to the creation and completion of tasks in Apollo. |\n| Linkedin Tasks | Metrics related to the creation and completion of tasks created from the Apollo extension on LinkedIn. |\n| Account | Metrics related to the interactions with accounts in Apollo. |\n| Contact | Metrics related to the interactions with contacts in Apollo. |\n| Deal | Metrics related to the performance of deals in the Apollo platform. |\n| Person | Metric related to the number of net new people saved as contacts in Apollo. |\n| Company | Metric related to the number of net new companies saved as accounts in Apollo. |\n\nClick the relevant metrics that you want to include in the custom report.

Apollo groups dimensions into 7 categories:\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| User | Dimension related to the specific individual(s) taking the action in Apollo. |\n| Date | Dimensions related to the time period of the action taken in Apollo. For example, day, hour, month, year, etc. |\n| Contact/Person | Dimensions related to the information about the individuals contacted from Apollo. For example, their persona type, their location, their stage in the sales pipeline, etc. |\n| Account/Company | Dimensions related to the information about the companies contacted from Apollo. For example, the account name, the number of company employees, the industry, related keywords, etc. |\n| Deal | Dimensions related to the deals in Apollo. For example, the deal owner, the current stage of the deal, etc. |\n| Email | Dimensions related to the type of emails sent from Apollo. For example, email subject and template used can be dimensions. |\n| Phone Call | Dimensions related to the purpose and disposition of the phone calls made from Apollo. |\n| Sequence | Dimensions related to the name of the sequence or the specific step that was used to engage with the prospects in Apollo. |\n\nDimensions Per Report\n\nYou might notice some overlap between specific items in the metrics and dimensions lists. This is because you can use many types of data as either a metric or dimension.\n\nClick the relevant dimension(s) that you want to include in the custom report. You can add a maximum of 2 dimensions per report. If you add a persona as a dimension, data will be grouped by active personas, and [inactive personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/6128371592845)\u00a0will not appear in your reports.\n\nApollo adds the selected dimensions as rows in the table.\n\n[![Dimensions Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i8.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Configure Filters[](#toc_5)\n\nFrom the new custom report, click **Filters**.\n\n[![Filters View](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i9.png)\n\nClick **Add Filter**.\n\n[![Add Filters](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i12.png)\n\nFilters are specific subsets of data that you want to visualize in your report.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo enables you to build an integration between the web forms on your own website and the scheduling functionality of its [inbound router](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109). Your web forms can serve as a substitute for the intake forms you create when setting up inbound routers.\n\nContinue to collect data from prospects on your website, and then provide them with the ability to easily schedule meetings with your team based on the inbound routers you create in Apollo. This can be accomplished in a single, seamless workflow.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 0: Before You Begin[](#toc_2)\n\nThe instructions provided in the [Step 1](#step-1-create-an-inbound-router-or-use-an-existing-router) and [Step 2](#step-2-copy-apollo-js-snippet-and-map-fields) sections of this article can be completed by an Apollo admin. Technical skills are not required.\n\nThe [Step 3](#step-3-build-your-web-form-integration) instructions require knowledge of HTML and a front-end language like JavaScript, along with access to your website's codebase. If you or your team do not possess those technical skills or access, work with your organization to arrange the necessary help.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Create an Inbound Router (or Use an Existing Router)[](#toc_3)\n\nYou will map your web form fields to the fields in an Apollo inbound router. Create (or update) an inbound router that includes all of the fields that you want to map to your web form.\n\nIf you have already created an inbound router with the fields you want to map, proceed to [Step 2](#step-2-copy-apollo-js-snippet-and-map-fields).\n\nIf you do not have an inbound router with the desired fields, please refer to [Create Inbound Routers for Your Meetings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109) to learn how to create or update inbound routers. Then, return to this article and continue with [Step 2](#step-2-copy-apollo-js-snippet-and-map-fields).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Copy Apollo JS Snippet and Map Fields[](#toc_4)\n\nWith an inbound router created, you can proceed to mapping the fields between your web form and Apollo, and then generating the JavaScript snippet to add to your website.\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click\u00a0[**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/meeting-types).\n2.  Click **Inbound routers**. Find the inbound router you want to use with your web form, and then click **additional options** (...) **Share**. [![Find your inbound router.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i3.png)\n3.  Click the **Integrate with your website form** tab. Enter the domain(s) where your web form is located, and then press enter on your keyboard to save your domain entries. Apollo does not support trailing slashes, so do not include `/` at the end of your domains.\n    \n    You can add up to 5 domains, including subdomains. For example, Apollo integrating web forms on `https://app.apollo.io` and `https://knowledge.apollo.io` would occupy 2 of the 5 available domains. [![Add the domains where your web forms are located.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i10.png)\n    \n4.  Click the **Form field autofill** toggle if you want Apollo to automatically populate any fields with Apollo data when a user inputs their email address into your form. [![Form field autofill toggle in share router popup](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i11.png)\n5.  Then, click the **Hide autofilled form fields** toggle if you want to streamline the form filling experience for your prospects. Form shortening hides any fields that Apollo autofills from the end user's view. This means that your prospects will only see and need to fill out the fields for which Apollo does not have data. You need to activate the form field autofill toggle to enable this feature. [![Form field autofill toggle in share router popup](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i12.png)\n    \n    Be Mindful\n    \n    Please note, Apollo recommends that you use the form field autofill feature with caution. If you don't want to alarm a prospect when a field automatically populates with their data, consider enabling the form field autofill and form shortening features together.\n    \n    Please also note that for form autofill and shortening to work, your webform must be structered correctly as per HTML semantics. Make sure you have wrapped all inputs within the form element and assigned relevent label tags. You must also ensure that you map your inbound router fields to your web form fields correctly, as per the following step.\n    \n6.  Next, map your inbound router fields to your web form fields. The inbound router fields are already populated, so you only need to enter the corresponding web form field. If an inbound router field allows a prospect to select from multiple options, you should ensure that your web form provides the same options.\n    \n    The web form field names entered here **must match** the field names in your code. If there is an `emailaddress` field in the code of your web form, enter that full name, not `email`.\n    \n    Once you have mapped all your fields, select **Continue**. [![Enter your website form fields.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i5.png)\n    \n7.  Apollo generates the JavaScript snippet to add to your website. Click **Copy Code** to add it to your clipboard, and then click **Done** to exit.\n    \n    If you are building the rest of the integration on your website, keep the code snippet yourself. Otherwise, send it to the personnel that will complete the integration setup. [![Copy the JavaScript code snippet.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i2.png)\n    \n\nWith your code snippet generated, continue to [Step 3](#step-3-build-your-web-form-integration).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 3: Build Your Web Form Integration[](#toc_5)\n\nTo integrate your web form with Apollo meetings, you must have the JavaScript snippet generated by Apollo in Step 2. If you don't have the snippet, please follow the instructions in Step 2 before attempting to update your website.\n\nThe following sub-sections provide the building blocks that you can use to build your integration, from establishing the basic flow of passing the web form entries to defining more advanced options.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Add the JS Snippet to Your Website[](#toc_6)\n\nAdd the JavaScript snippet generated in [Step 2](#step-2-copy-apollo-js-snippet-and-map-fields) to your website's code.\n\nIn the following example, Apollo added the snippet between the `head` tags of a website's HTML.\n\n[![JavaScript snippet added to website header.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i6.png)\n\nThe snippet creates a `window.ApolloMeetings` object that can be accessed from anywhere in the app/console. You should use this object to both pass web form entries to Apollo and, if you choose, to utilize custom options.\n\n [![This is the window.ApolloMeetings object.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_web_form_meetings/i7.png)[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Customize initWidget[](#toc_7)\n\nThe `initWidget` initiates the scheduling flow from Apollo. Access it via the `window.ApolloMeetings` object.\n\n```\n\ninitWidget: ({ appId: string, schedulingLink: string, domElement?: HTMLElement }) = void;\n```\n\nThis widget includes 3 elements:\n\n*   **appId**: This is a unique ID that is generated along with the JavaScript snippet in Apollo.\n*   **schedulingLink**: An identifier for your inbound router.\n*   **domElement**: By default, Apollo adds the widget at the end of your website's `body` tag. If you prefer to open the widget on a different element, you can define that choice here.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Pass Web Form Submissions Data to Apollo[](#toc_8)\n\nWith Apollo's JS snippet added to your website, you need to capture the data from your web form's submissions and pass the entries to Apollo.\n\nThe easiest way to pass the entries is to use `window.ApolloMeetings.submit()` without defining any options. By default, this option captures entries from the first form element on a webpage and passes them to Apollo via an API call. Only input elements with `name` attributes are captured.\n\n```\n\nconst handleFormSubmit = () = {\n    window.ApolloMeetings.submit()\n}\n```\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Add Third-party Form Integrations[](#toc_9)\n\nIn addition to your own web forms, you can also capture data from HubSpot and Marketo web form submissions on your website and pass those entries to Apollo. You still need to add Apollo's JS snippet to your website.\n\n**HubSpot**\n\nFor HubSpot forms, add the following snippet to your website. When a user submits the HubSpot form, the data is passed to Apollo and the scheduling flow is triggered. Hubspot forms dispatch an event called `hsFormCallback` on the window object, which has the values of the Hubspot form integrated on the respective website. A listener to this event is attached to the window object.\n\n```\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"message\", function(event) {\n  if (event.data.type === \"hsFormCallback\" && event.data.eventName === \"onFormSubmitted\") {\n    const lead = event.data.data.submissionValues;\n    window.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n      map: false,\n      lead\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Marketo**\n\nFor Marketo forms, add the following snippet to your website. When a user submits the Marketo form, the data is passed to Apollo and the scheduling flow is triggered. This snippet attaches Apollo's submit function to the `MktoForms2.loadForm` method.\n\n```\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(BASE_URL, MUNCHKIN_ID, FORM_ID, function(form) {\n  form.onSuccess(function(values) {\n    window.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n      map: false,\n      lead: values\n    });\n    return false;\n  });\n});\n```\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Define Options[](#toc_10)\n\nIn addition to using `window.ApolloMeetings.submit()` to pass web form entires to Apollo, you can set several options to improve the experience for you and your prospects.\n\n**formId (String)**\n\nBy default, Apollo captures entries from the first web form to appear on a webpage. Any element of a webpage that captures user input could be a form though.\n\nUse `formId` to capture entries from a specific form. Use the `id` attribute from the form and add it in `window.ApolloMeetings.submit()`.\n\n```\n\nconst handleFormSubmit = (e) = {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    // myForm is the id attribute for the form.\n    window.ApolloMeetings.submit({formId : \"myForm\"});\n};\n```\n\n**map (Boolean)** and **lead (Object)**\n\nBy default, `map` is set to `false`, which means Apollo handles extracting the data from your web form. Apollo relies on `input` tags in your form's HTML to retrieve this information.\n\nIf you prefer to use the [Salesforce lead object format](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm), set `map` to `true`. Then, define `lead` per the following code example so that the correct data is passed to Apollo.\n\n```\n\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n    map: true, \n    lead : {name: state.name, email: state.email}\n});\n```\n\n**closeOnOutside (Boolean)**\n\nThe scheduling flow is delivered via an Apollo pop-up window. By default, a prospect clicking the gray background area outside the pop-up closes the window.\n\nTo change this behavior, set `closeOnOutside` to `true`.\n\n```\n\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n    closeOnOutside : true\n});\n```\n\n**preventRedirect (Boolean)** and **onRedirect (String)**\n\nWhen creating an inbound router in Apollo, you can choose to [send prospects to an external URL](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_4). This option prevents non-ideal prospects from booking meetings.\n\nIf the inbound router uses this option, you can choose to take control of all the URL redirects and send prospects to a different URL. This could enable you to perform better metric tracking or to pass prospects through URL shorteners.\n\nIf you want to change the redirect, set `preventRedirect` to `false`. Then, set `onRedirect` to the desired URL.\n\n```\n\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n    preventRedirect: false,\n    // Enter the URL you want to use for the redirect.\n    onRedirect :(url) = {https://www.replacethisurl.com}\n});\n```\n\n**onSuccess (Function)**, **onError (Function)**, and **onRouted (Function)**\n\nUse these 3 callback functions to determine what happens after a prospect has submitted a web form.\n\nSet `onSuccess` to define what happens after a prospect has successfully scheduled a meeting.\n\nIf the inbound router fails at any point, Apollo delivers the specific error in response. Set `onError` to guide the prospect after the error.\n\n```\n\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n    // Define your error function.\n    onError : (error) = {},\n    // Define your success function.\n    onSuccess: () = {}\n})\n```\n\nSet `onRouted` to call a function when the inbound router has been triggered. This occurs after the web form is submitted, but before the prospect has either successfully or unsuccessfuly scheduled a meeting.\n\n```\n\nwindow.ApolloMeetings.submit({\n    onRouted : (result) = {\n        if(result.success) {\n            // routing success\n            // get what type of routing happeneded from \n            const type = result.type\n        } else {\n            // routing failure, see error in result.error\n            const error = result.error\n        }\n    }\n})\n```\n\n`onRouter` provides details about both whether an action was successfully reached in the inbound router and, if so, which action was reached.\n\n```\n\nonRouted?: \n    ( params: | { success: false; error: string } | \n        { success: true; type: 'custom_message' | 'book_meeting' | 'redirect_to_url' }, ) = void;\n```\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19083452478733-Integrate-Your-Web-Forms-with-Meetings"}

If you require customizable reports and dashboards, work with your Apollo representative or contact the [Apollo Sales Team](mailto: sales@apollo.io) to move to a Custom plan.\n\n**Apollo Analytics** provide you with actionable data you can use to transform your company's sales efforts. One facet of the **Analytics** suite is the **Dashboards** feature. **Dashboards** provide you with a means of visualizing several related reports in a common interface.\n\nRefer to the sections below to learn how to create custom **Dashboards**, access existing **Dashboards**, and better understand the various features you have at your disposal.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Access Dashboards in Apollo[](#toc_2)\n\nTo access **Dashboards**, launch Apollo and click **Engage**.\n\n[![Engage](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i1.png)\n\nClick **Analytics**.\n\n[![Analytics](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_reports/i2.png)\n\nClick **Dashboards**.\n\n[![Dashboard Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)\n\nAny previously created **Dashboards** are available on the left-hand side of the screen.\n\n[![Dashboards View](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)\n\nIf you would like to create a new **Dashboard**, click **\\+ New Dashboard**.\n\n[![New Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I3.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create a New Custom Dashboard[](#toc_3)\n\nFrom the **Dashboards** section of the **Analytics** page, click **\\+ New Dashboard**.\n\nThere are 3 main configuration components of any **Dashboard**: **Reports**, **Filters**, and **Data Range**. The sections below outline how to set up each of these **Dashboard** components.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Add Reports[](#toc_4)\n\nFrom the new **Dashboard**, there are several ways to add **Reports**.\n\n**Reports** aggregate in-app metrics into various visualization types while using specific filters to refine the visualizations. **Dashboards** aggregate those **Reports** into a single location. You can include as many **Reports** in a **Dashboard** as you would like.\n\n#### Add Existing Reports[](#toc_5)\n\nYou can use the search bar on the right-hand side of your screen to find a **Report** to add to your **Dashboard**.\n\n[![Search Reports](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i4.png)\n\nOnce you find the **Report**, click it to add it to the **Dashboard**.\n\n[![Click Reports](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i41.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i41.png)\n\nSearch is Optional\n\nPlease note, if you know which **Reports** that you want to add to the **Dashboard** you can click them directly and ignore the search feature.\n\nYou can [rearrange the report tiles](#14) as needed.\n\n#### Create and Add New Reports[](#toc_6)\n\nAlthough the process is less streamlined, you can create new **Custom Reports** directly from a new **Dashboard**. To add a new **Report** to the **Dashboard**, make sure you give the **Dashboard** a name and save it.\n\n[![Name Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I5.png)\n\nDashboard Naming\n\nAs a best practice, consider a **Dashboard** name that reflects its intended **Data Range** (for example, \"Monthly\"), its intended use (for example, \"SDR Performance\"), and if necessary, the intended audience for which it's meant (for example, \"SDR Manager\").\n\nOnce it's saved, click **Edit Dashboard**.\n\n[![Edit Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)\n\nClick **\\+ New Report**.\n\n[![New Report](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i7.png)\n\nFollow the instructions in the [Build and Access Reports in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410826842381#13) article to create your **New Report**.\n\nAfter you create and save the new **Report**, click the **Dashboard** tab on the left-hand side of your screen.\n\n[![Dashboard Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)\n\nThen, click the name of the **Dashboard** that you want to add the new **Report** to.\n\n[![Click Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i8.png)\n\nClick **Edit Dashboard**.\n\n[![Edit Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)\n\nClick the new **Report** that you just created on the right-hand side of your screen to add it to the **Dashboard**.\n\n[![Add Reports to Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i9.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Configure Filters[](#toc_7)\n\nWithin a **Dashboard**, you can apply additional filters to all of the included **Reports**.\n\nAfter you save your **Dashboard**, click **Filters**.\n\n[![Dashboard Filters](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i10.png)\n\nClick **\\+ Add Filter**.\n\n[![+Add Filter](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i11.png)\n\n**Filters** allow you to include or exclude specific subsets of data in every **Report** on your **Dashboard**. You can add as many **Filters** as you need to each **Dashboard**.\n\nDashboard-Level Filters\n\nPlease note, the **Filters** that you apply on a **Dashboard** do not override the **Filters** from individual **Reports**. They act as add-ons to the already existing filters in each **Report**.\n\nApollo groups filters into the following categories:\n\n| Category | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| User | Filter related to the specific individual(s) taking the action in the Apollo platform |\n| Date | Filters related to the time period of the action taken in the Apollo platform (for example, day, hour, month, year, etc.) |\n| Contact/Person | Filters related to the information about the individuals contacted from the Apollo platform (for example, their persona type, their location, their stage in the sales pipeline, etc.) |\n| Account/Company | Filters related to the information about the companies contacted from the Apollo platform (for example, the account name, the number of company employees, the industry, related keywords, etc.) |\n| Email | Filters related to the type of emails sent from the Apollo platform (for example, email subject, template used, etc.) |\n| Phone Call | Filters related to the purpose and disposition of the phone calls made from the Apollo platform |\n| Sequence | Filters related to the name of the sequence or the specific step that was used to engage with the prospects in the Apollo platform |\n\nClick **Select Filter** to choose the relevant dimensions that you want to include in your **Dashboard**.\n\n[![Dashboard Filter Dimensions](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i12.png)\n\nClick the **Select** drop-down to include or exclude additional metrics.\n\n[![Dashboard Filter Metrics](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i13.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i13.png)\n\nClick **Run** to update the **Dashboard** with the new **Filters**.\n\n[![Run Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i14.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i14.png)\n\nTo delete a **Filter**, click the trash can icon on the right-hand side of the screen.\n\n[![Delete Filters](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i15.png)\n\nThen, click **Run** to implement the changes.\n\n[![Run Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i16.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i16.png)\n\nOverlapping Filters\n\nPlease note, if you apply a **Dashboard Filter** that's in direct conflict with a **Filter** from any of the **Reports** in your new **Dashboard**, Apollo discards and replaces the **Report Filter** with the **Dashboard Filter** whenever you view the **Dashboard**; however, when you view the individual **Report**, the original **Filter** will remain in effect.\n\nTo make the best use of **Dashboard Filters**, first, build each report with the **Filters** you have in mind. When you add **Reports** to the **Dashboard** and want to view the same metrics for a different set of users, emails, contacts, etc., you can then apply a **Dashboard Filter** to further refine the visible data.\n\nFor example, you can create a report for a specific SDR or ADR. You can add it to an SDR/ADR team **Dashboard** and add a filter on the **Dashboard** to view metrics for all of your SDR/ADRs instead of just the one.\n\nDashboard Filters\n\nPlease note, you do not have to set **Filters** for a new **Dashboard**. If you choose not to set **Dashboard Filters**, the original **Filters** on each **Report** remain in effect.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Configure Data Range[](#toc_8)\n\nFrom the new **Dashboard**, click the timeframe on the right-hand side (in this instance, the label displays **No Data Range Specified**).\n\n[![Dashboard Data Range](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I17.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/I17.png)\n\nClick **Select Data Range**.\n\n[![Select Data Range](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i18.png)\n\nThink about the **Data Range** like the gap of time for all of the data in the **Dashboard**. Apollo provides several defined timeframes for the data that you want to visualize in your **Dashboard**.\n\n[![Dynamic Data Ranges](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i19.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i19.png)\n\nYou can also define your own timeframe using the **Custom Range** option.\n\n[![Custom Data Range](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i20.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i20.png)\n\nIf you apply a **Dashboard Data Range**, it overrides the **Data Range** set in every individual **Report** included in the **Dashboard**. This change only applies to the **Dashboards** page. If you view any of the individual **Reports** in your **Dashboard** from the **Reports** page, the original **Data Range** remains in effect.\n\nAfter you apply a **Dashboard Data Range**, you can change it to another **Data Range** any time you like; however, you cannot delete it altogether.\n\nIf you choose a **Dynamic Data Range** (for example, **Current Week**, **Last 90 Days**, or **This Quarter**), remember to click **Run** on a regular basis. This will ensure that the data you view is always up-to-date.\n\nDashboard Data Ranges\n\nPlease note, you do not have to set a **Data Range** for a new **Dashboard**. If you choose not to set a **Dashboard Data Range**, the original timeframe set on each **Report** remains in effect.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Launch Existing Dashboards[](#toc_9)\n\nAs the name implies, **Existing Dashboards** are the **Dashboards** already present in the Apollo platform. They include any **Dashboards** you or your team have created.\n\n**Public Dashboards** and **Private Dashboards** are both available from the **Analytics** page. From that page, click the \"Dashboards\" tab, scroll down the \"Dashboards\" column, and click the **Dashboard** you want to open.\n\n[![Dashboards View](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)\n\nAnother way to find an **Existing Dashboard** is to use the **Search Bar**.\n\n[![Dashboard Search bar](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i21.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i21.png)\n\nThere are several features available when you work with **Existing Dashboards**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Edit Existing Dashboards[](#toc_10)\n\nFrom the **Analytics** page, click the **Dashboards** tab.\n\n[![Dashboard Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i1.png)\n\nYou can use the **Search bar** to find a **Dashboard** or browse through folders on the left-hand side and click the **Dashboard** that you want to edit.\n\n[![Dashboards View](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i2.png)\n\nSelect the **Dashboard** and then click **Edit Dashboard** on the right-hand side.\n\n[![Edit Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i6.png)\n\nYou can also click the additional options (**...**) button next to any **Dashboards** and then click **Edit**.\n\n[![Edit Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i22.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i22.png)\n\nFrom the **Dashboard**, you have several editing options:\n\n*   [Add or Remove Report Tiles](#12)\n*   [Edit Reports](#13)\n*   [Re-size, Drag, and Drop Report Tiles](#14)\n*   [Move and Rename Existing Dashboards](#15)\n*   [Reorganize Dashboards](#16)\n\n#### Add or Remove Reports From a Dashboard[](#toc_11)\n\nTo add new and existing **Reports** to a **Dashboard**, follow the instructions in the [Add Reports](#4) section above.\n\nTo remove a **Report** from a **Dashboard**, click the additional options (**...**) button on the right-hand side of a **Report** on the **Dashboard**.

Then, click the additional options (**...**) button on the right-hand side of the **Report Tile**.\n\n[![Edit Report Tile](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i24.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i24.png)\n\nFrom the selected **Report**, you can customize the components as needed. Follow the instructions in the [Build and Access Reports in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410826842381) article for further details on how to edit an individual **Report**.\n\nAfter you edit the **Report**, return to the \"Dashboards\" tab. To review the changes, click the **Dashboard** that includes the **Report**.\n\n[![Review Report Changes](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i42.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i42.png)\n\nClick **Run** to view the most up-to-date data.\n\n[![Refresh Dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i43.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/analytics_overview_custom_dashboards/i43.png)\n\n#### Resize and Arrange Report Tiles in a Dashboard[](#toc_13)\n\nFrom the **Dashboard**, you can change the layout of included reports.\n\nClick the blue resize icon on the bottom right-hand side of the **Report Tile** that you want to resize.

{"text": "A Bit of Beta Makes it Better!\n\nThis feature is currently in Beta. If you cannot access all the latest and greatest scoring updates yet, we haven't forgotten you! Please bear with us while we fine-tune the magic formula.\n\n## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nWhen you integrate CRMs like [Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/7525314188173#toc_3) and [HubSpot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19745130546573#toc_3) with Apollo, there are several steps you can take to reduce the risk of duplicating records.\n\nHowever, if duplicate data is already present, you can reduce those duplicate records using Apollo's data deduplication tool. The tool enables you to set the criteria for what is considered a duplicate record and review the potential duplicates before Apollo merges them. This improves data integrity and ensures that your team can trust the data in Apollo.\n\nAdmin Only\n\nOnly users with admin permissions in Apollo can use the data deduplication tool. If you do not have access, please contact the Apollo admins in your organization.\n\n## Step 1: Set Criteria for Identifying Duplicate Records[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo identifies duplicate records based on your criteria. By adjusting the criteria, you increase the likelihood of identifying the duplicates you want to merge.\n\nTo set the criteria for data deduplication:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Data enrichment**](https://app.apollo.io/#/data-health-center).\n2.  Click **Configure duplicate detection rules**. [![Set up rules.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i39.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i39.png)\n3.  In the **Matching rules** tab, click the checkbox for each rule that you want Apollo to use to identify duplicate records. For example, select **Email address** if you want contact records with the same email address to be considered potential duplicates.\n    \n    Add multiple rules to increase match confidence. If you use multiple rules, click **Mark as main** to use a rule as the primary criterion for determining the contact record to keep after merging records.\n    \n    Then, click **Next**. [![Determine how duplicates are identified.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i41.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i41.png)\n    \n4.  In the **Primary record selection** tab, drag and drop the prioritization rules to place them in order of importance. Apollo uses these rules to determine which record among duplicates is the primary record, which is the record that remains after the merge. Click **Show rule details** to review an explanation of each rule.\n    \n    With the rules in order, click **Configure**. [![Set rules for determining the primary record.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i42.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i42.png)\n    \n\nWith your rules set, you are ready to merge duplicate records.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Merge Duplicate Records[](#toc_2)\n\nWith your criteria for identifying duplicate records set, you are ready to merge duplicate records in Apollo.\n\nTo merge a set of duplicate records:\n\n1.  Click **View duplicates**. [![View your duplicate records.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i43.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/eliminate_duplicate_records/i43.png)\n2.

Review the full details for each duplicate contact record. Apollo determines the primary record based on the rules you established in the [Step 1](#toc_1) section. If you want to change the primary record, click the **trophy** for the record you want to make the primary.\n    \n    Differences between the duplicate records are highlighted in red. For example, if most duplicate records use the same job title, the records with a different title might be highlighted red.

To merge all of the records in a group, click **Merge all**.\n    \n    To merge specific records, click the checkbox for each record you want to merge, then click **Merge selected**.\n    \n    Click **Reject selected** or **Reject all** to reject records from being merged.

The source of truth entry takes precedent over the entry you merged in. For example, when Apollo merges custom fields, if the source of truth has a different value for the same custom field, it is **not** overwritten. If the custom field is empty in the source of truth, Apollo merges the data into the source of truth.\n\nAccount lists, contacts, and user activities are added to the existing list in the source of truth.\n\nIn addition, the following information is also copied over in a merge, if it is available:\n\n*   Account Name\n*   Account Enrichment Information\n*   Account Website\n*   Account Notes\n*   Account Stage\n*   Account Owner\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413318604685-Merge-Account-Data-Overview"}

Before you get started with your outreach, you need to set concrete goals, decide upon the metrics that you wish to use to measure your success, and set a benchmark of comparison from which you can build.\n\nStart by thinking about:\n\n*   How many accounts and contacts do you wish to engage with\n*   How many emails you will send out per day\n*   How many touches\u2014or, number of times you engage a prospect\u2014you will include in each sequence\n\nIf you have run previous campaigns, you can use your historical data as a benchmark of comparison. If this is your first outbound campaign, you can use the sample metrics in this module as a reference so that when you start to gather the results from your new campaigns, you will have quantitative data to measure against your results. There are a number of data points you can focus on. We\u2019d recommend concentrating on the following to begin with:\n\n*   % of email open rates\n*   % of replies\n*   % of interested contacts\n*   The number of meetings set\n*   The number of closed/won deals\n\nStart by drafting out the data points that you want to gather in your own **Outbound Sales Metrics** table:\n\n| Type of Metric | Data Points to Measure | Benchmark Metrics |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Targeting | *   \\# Accounts<br>*   \\# Contacts/Accounts<br>*   \\# Emails/Contacts |     |\n| Activity | *   \\# Emails |     |\n| Quality of Activity | *   % Email Open<br>*   % Email Reply<br>*   % Email Interested Rate |     |\n| Results | *   \\# Meetings from Email |     |\n| Sales Cycle | *   Meeting \u2014 Win Rate<br>*   Closed/Won Deals |     |\n\nEach metric you measure will provide you with key insights into the growth and health of your sales strategies. Gathering the data and analyzing the performance of your sales efforts allows you to constantly review, experiment, and improve to reach your sales targets.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Apollo Example[](#toc_2)\n\n[![Apollo Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)\n\nIn the table below, we have included sample metrics that you can use as a benchmark when first starting out.\n\n| Type of Metric | Data Points to Measure | Benchmark Results | My Metrics: Month 1 | Analysis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Targeting | *   \\# Accounts<br>*   \\# Contacts/Accounts<br>*   \\# Emails/Contacts | *   100-1000<br>*   2-5<br>*   2-5 |     |     |\n| Activity | *   \\# Emails | *   200-500 per day |     |     |\n| Quality of Activity | *   % Email Open<br>*   % Email Reply<br>*   % Email Interested Rate | *   30%-50%<br>*   1%-10%<br>*   0.2%-2% |     |     |\n| Results | *   \\# Meetings from Email | *   10-20 per month |     |     |\n| Sales Cycle | *   Meeting \u2014 Win Rate<br>*   Closed/Won Deals | *   20%-30%<br>*   2-5 per month |     |     |\n\nStart Here, but Don't Stay Here!\n\nThe more data you gather and metrics you measure, the less relevant these benchmark statistics will become. Over time, you will need to use your historical data as the biggest judge of your progress; adapting your target metrics to fit your specific business, industry, and market.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Dissecting the Numbers[](#toc_3)\n\nOnce you decide upon the number of companies that you want to target\u2014between 100 and 1,000 is a good starting point\u2014you need to decide how many contacts you will target within each account and how many times you will engage with each person. We recommend that you start by contacting at least 2-5 contacts from within the same company and sending at least 2-5 emails to each.\n\nPro Tip!\n\nMake sure you don\u2019t engage with all of the contacts at the same company at the same time. Instead, try to space out your communications with prospects from the same company across multiple days.\n\nNow that you know how many accounts you want to target, think about how many emails you should send in a day. A good benchmark for Apollo users is anywhere between 200-500 emails per rep, per day. This provides you with a large enough sample size to analyze the quality of the activity and calculate the conversion rates between opened emails, replies, meetings set, and closed deals.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to the % email interest rate. This is a key statistic that provides insight into the number of contacts that have confirmed they would like to attend a meeting from the total number of emails you sent out in a month. Using this information, you can then determine the conversion rates per sales rep. Generally speaking, each sales rep should be aiming to secure at least 10-20 meetings per month, but depending on your industry, coaching methods, and approach, one rep could set up as many as 50-100 meetings per month.\n\nThe more meetings you set, the better chance you have of closing deals. As a benchmark, try to achieve at least a 20%-30% win rate by closing 2-5 deals per month per rep. But always keep in mind that these target metrics are according to the industry average. They give you an idea of the baseline statistics for outbound sales. However, after the first few months of outreach, you should be able to gain a better understanding of what\u2019s possible for your company in your specific market. You can then adapt your sales targets accordingly.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## **Practical Exercise**[](#toc_4)\n\n[![Practical Exercise](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)\n\nCopy the benchmark results into the metrics table you created earlier and add two new columns for your own metrics and reflections. Please note, you won\u2019t need to fill these columns in until you complete this course and begin executing your outbound sales strategy in Apollo, so keep the table handy and get ready to jump back into it when you have your first month of data to record and compare.\n\n| Type of Metric | Data Points to Measure | Benchmark Results | My Metrics: Month 1 | Analysis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Targeting | *   \\# Accounts<br>*   \\# Contacts/Accounts<br>*   \\# Emails/Contacts | *   100-1000<br>*   2-5<br>*   2-5 |     |     |\n| Activity | *   \\# Emails | *   200-500 per day |     |     |\n| Quality of Activity | *   % Email Open<br>*   % Email Reply<br>*   % Email Interested Rate | *   30%-50%<br>*   1%-10%<br>*   0.2%-2% |     |     |\n| Results | *   \\# Meetings from Email | *   10-20 per month |     |     |\n| Sales Cycle | *   Meeting \u2014 Win Rate<br>*   Closed/Won Deals | <li20%-30%>*   2-5 per month<br></li20%-30%> |     |     |\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Next Steps[](#toc_5)\n\n[![Next Steps](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)\n\nNow that you have some sample metrics and key data points at the ready so that you can compare and calculate your team\u2019s conversion rates, continue to the next article in this course to learn about how to \"[**Create a Product Market Fit Canvas**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120338103693-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Create-a-Product-Market-Fit-Canvas).\" In this next module, we will discuss the key role that your PMF hypothesis will play as you start to develop an effective outbound sales process for your company.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120718002701-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Metrics"}

Here, you will learn the basic principles that define an effective sales strategy and will come away with concrete examples to help you reach, engage, and convert the right prospects, at the right time.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### The Apollo Story[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo started out in 2015 with a big vision and a lot to learn\u2014outbound sales have since become instrumental to our revenue and business growth. In early 2016, we went from $20,000 in revenue to $300,000 in 4 months. By the end of 2016, we went from $300,000 in revenue to $1 million in 3 months. Just a few years down the road and Apollo is now a world leader in the data intelligence and sales engagement space. The Apollo platform helps over 10,000 paying customers and over half a million Apollo users to build and scale their outbound sales systems. These results were achieved almost exclusively thanks to the outbound sales process that we have followed. In this course, we will be dissecting the ingredients of our success so that you can take actionable steps to achieve similar results for your company.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Outbound Sales 101 Overview[](#toc_3)\n\nWhat is an Outbound Sales Process and why do you need to develop one for your business? It all boils down to one simple concept:\n\n**To operate a business, you need revenue. To generate revenue, you need to secure meetings and convert those conversations into sales**.\n\nNot all companies use outbound sales tactics. Some depend primarily on inbound sales and referrals. Although these methodologies have their benefits, they can only take your business so far. Companies that create an effective outbound sales process are able to generate opportunities quickly and repeatedly at scale.\n\n[![Purpose](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_overview/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_overview/i2.png)\n\nOutbound sales is a tried and tested tactic for companies in all stages of growth. You may choose to tap into outbound strategies before your product is even live or to generate your first 10 customers. On the other hand, you may use outbound to scale your business from 10 to 200 customers or from 200 to 10,000. The sales strategy you execute should depend on the specific stage in which your business is at. In this **Build an Outbound Sales Process** course, we will concentrate on the outbound tactics to follow if you want to take your business from 1 to 10 customers or from 10 to 200 customers.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Course Outline[](#toc_4)\n\nWe\u2019ve broken this course into 6 bite-sized chunks:\n\n### Outbound Sales Metrics[](#toc_5)\n\nSales metrics help you to gauge the success of your sales efforts over time. You can use a number of data points to evaluate and compare your results against your business goals. This module will look at some sample sales metrics that you can use as a benchmark when first carrying out your outbound sales strategy. By the end of this course, you should be ready to adapt these metrics to your business goals and target market so that you can continue to scale your sales initiatives and in turn, dramatically boost revenue.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Create a Product Market Fit Canvas[](#toc_6)\n\nA Product Market Fit Canvas is a holistic summary of the different facets of your product and value propositions matched against the main goals, challenges, and needs of your market. In this module, we\u2019ll deep dive into the PMF fundamentals, look at examples, and equip you with the knowledge you need to create your own Product Market Fit Canvas for every outbound campaign that you run.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Target Real Buyers[](#toc_7)\n\nSales targeting is the process in which you identify, find, target, and engage with the right contacts, from the right companies, through the right channels, at the right time. In this module, you\u2019ll learn more about why targeting is important, you\u2019ll see examples of how to use Apollo to find your ideal customers, and you\u2019ll put this knowledge into practice with a practical exercise.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Craft Killer Sales Email Messaging[](#toc_8)\n\nWriting effective outbound sales messaging means learning how to speak the language of your potential customers and transmitting your message to the right people in a concise, engaging, and relatable way. There are many methods to crafting optimal sales messaging to engage and convert your ideal prospects. In this module, we will focus primarily on leveraging the Research, Reference, Reward, and Request approach, we will share some useful resources, provide examples of first touch and follow-up messages, and set you up for writing your own killer messaging within Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Outbound Sales Analytics[](#toc_9)\n\nSales analytics play a fundamental role in understanding and improving your outbound sales strategy. By analyzing the data from your campaigns, you can A/B test different tactics, evaluate what is and isn\u2019t working, and make strategic improvements to increase your open, click, response, and win rates. In this module, you\u2019ll learn about what to experiment with and why. You\u2019ll also find out more about how to leverage the Apollo Analytics tool to gain valuable insights into the performance of your sales campaigns.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Additional Considerations[](#toc_10)\n\nIn sales, there is no single right answer for all prospects. The tactics that work on one of your buyer personas may not work on another. The channels, messaging, number of touches, and overall approach you take are likely to differ drastically depending on many factors such as industry, Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), and product offerings. In this course, you will learn how to choose the type of approach that best fits your business. On top of that, we\u2019ll look at how to keep your domain healthy and the best methods to avoid SPAM so you can ensure your emails arrive safe and sound in the right inboxes at the right time.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Practical Exercise[](#toc_11)\n\n[![Practical Exercise](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)\n\nWithout checking the information above, write down the 6 facets that make up an effective outbound sales process. Next to each one, write down your understanding of each and why you think they are important aspects of a successful sales strategy. Put your notes to one side and come back to them at the end of the course to compare and evaluate how much you\u2019ve learned.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Next Steps[](#toc_12)\n\n[![Next Steps](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)\n\nReady to get started?

You can use **Sequences** to A/B test messages and ensure that you successfully engage with your customers. You can then hyper-focus your messaging and personalize your approach with information from LinkedIn.\n\nThis use case explores the steps you can take to leverage LinkedIn with **Sequences**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Sample Workflow[](#toc_2)\n\n### Find the Right Contacts[](#toc_3)\n\nThe first thing you need to do before you can launch an effective campaign is to find the right contacts that match your vision. Randomly contacting people is inefficient and won't yield positive results. You need to find a targeted audience.\n\n*   **Prospect with LinkedIn**\n\n*   It's easy to leverage data from LinkedIn to prospect with the tools Apollo provides. The first thing you should do is search for and request details about prospects from LinkedIn Sales Navigator, LinkedIn, or directly from the Apollo database. Read the [\"Prospect in LinkedIn\"](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409229262093-Prospect-in-LinkedIn) article for in-depth instructions.

You can prospect contact and account data directly from LinkedIn and complete many tasks through Apollo directly from LinkedIn, such as: request an email address, make a call, and add a saved contact to a list or **Sequence**. Read the [\"Apollo Chrome Extension Overview\"](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226637453-Apollo-Chrome-Extension-Overview) for more information.\n\n*   **Create Personas**\n\n*   **Personas** are sets of titles, seniorities, and departments that define different groups of people that you can target within key accounts. This allows you to find contacts faster with Apollo's search tool, receive better recommendations, and improve analytics. You can use **Personas** to narrow your LinkedIn searches.

For each contact in your **Sequence**, you can add steps to track interacting in LinkedIn from initial contact to sending a direct message. Apollo reminds you when you should complete different steps in the **Sequence** to keep you on task.

Some general best practices for LinkedIn messaging are:\n\n*   Personalize your messages\n*   Be direct and keep it short\n*   Clearly communicate your goal\n*   Suggest ways to meet or speak further\n*   Have a clear and concise signature\n*   Time your messages during normal business hours\n\n*   You should use the dynamic variables and snippets features in the message template to personalize your messaging at scale.

Part of executing your strategy is finding the perfect way to communicate your message and sometimes that requires trial and error to hone your skills. Here are some steps you can take to execute and perfect your strategy.\n\n*   **Add Contacts to Your Sequence**\n\n*   Now that you created your LinkedIn **Sequence**, you need to add contacts to it. When you add contacts to the LinkedIn **Sequence**, Apollo will track each contact through the steps you added to the **Sequence**. For more on how to add contacts to a **Sequence**, read the [\"**Add Contacts to a Sequence**\"](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence) article.

Apollo shows you which step a contact is in while they are in a **Sequence** when you visit their contact card. In this manner, you can track where exactly a contact is in the LinkedIn **Sequence**.

You should always be on the lookout for clearer wording and more personalized messaging to help grab the attention of your potential contacts. Over time, you should develop a comfort level with LinkedIn messaging and your results should improve.\n\nNo Overnight Successes\n\nPlease note, developing the right messaging strategy takes time and effort.

This means that when you begin your outreach efforts, you can ensure that your data is always up-to-date and in sync. It also means that you can visualize and stay in control of which team members contact which prospects.\n\nCRM Integration\n\nPlease note, Salesforce offers the largest degree of enrichment functionality in Apollo, but Apollo also supports CRM integrations with HubSpot.\n\nUse the links below for the CRM that you want to integrate and configure with Apollo.\n\nWhat if my company doesn't use a CRM?\n\nIf your company does not use a CRM to maintain information about your customers, you should upload a CSV of \"Do Not Contact\" customers to avoid reaching out to them. For more information about importing **contacts** into the Apollo platform, see the \"[Upload a CSV of Contacts to Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409161532045-Upload-a-CSV-of-Contacts-to-Apollo)\" article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### Salesforce[](#toc_4)\n\n**Integration**\n\n*   [Connect Apollo to Your Salesforce Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725-Connect-Apollo-to-Your-Salesforce-Account)\n*   [Understand Opportunity Stages and Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415294726029-Understand-Opportunity-Stages-and-Salesforce-)\n\n**Credentials**\n\n*   [Salesforce Credentials Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415287562893-Salesforce-Credentials-Overview)\n*   [Connect \"Team Sync\" Authentication Credentials to Your Salesforce Integration](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415294638733-Connect-Team-Sync-Authentication-Credentials-To-Your-Salesforce-Integration)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### HubSpot[](#toc_5)\n\n**Integration**\n\n*   [Connect Apollo to Your HubSpot Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416619021837)\n\nOnce you've connected your CRM to Apollo, your customer data stays accurate and in sync. Now, you're ready to connect your mailbox and set up your email signature.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Connect Your Mailbox[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you want to leverage Apollo **Engagement** tools to start sending messages in a **sequence** and convert more leads into sales, you must connect your mailbox first.\n\nLinking an email mailbox to Apollo allows you to email directly from an Apollo **sequence**. You can link any type of mailbox to Apollo. For a full list of the Email Service Providers (ESPs) that Apollo supports, refer to the \"[Supported Email Service Providers (ESPs)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140697101)\" article; however, Gmail provides the most compatibility and functionality in Apollo.\n\n[![Connected Mailbox](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i9.png)\n\nFollow the step by step instructions in the \"[Link Your Mailbox to Apollo.io](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io)\" article to get set up.\n\n[Back To Top](#top)\n\n### Set Up Your Email Signature[](#toc_7)\n\nNow that you have linked your mailbox, it's time to set up your email signature.\n\n[![Email Signature](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_your_email_signature/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_your_email_signature/i4.png)\n\nThere are several key advantages of using an email signature in your engagement emails.\n\n*   **Gaining trust**: The recipient can easily identify who has contacted them and from which company. If they want to research you before replying, they can do that.\n*   **Providing context and building rapport**: Your title and company name help indicate the nature and reason for your message. If you or your company are well-known in the industry, your signature may even add credibility to your email.\n*   **Encouraging responses**: If you include your contact information in the email, you increase the chances of a response. You also give the recipient the freedom to respond through the channel that suits them best.\n\nTo set up a unique signature for each mailbox that you have linked, follow the steps in [this article](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140295949-Set-Up-Your-Email-Signature).\n\nSPAM Filters and Links\n\nPlease note, as a best practice, you should avoid including links in your signature because they may trigger SPAM filters for new **contacts** that you have not emailed before.

They help your team deliver communications to your customers and complete the right tasks at the right time to speed your prospects through your pipeline and turn them into paying customers as efficiently as possible.\n\nAs you use Apollo to hone in on your **Ideal Customer Profiles**, you can create **sequences** to match each type of prospect with automatic and manual messages, LinkedIn engagement, calls, and action items that speak directly to the needs and challenges of your target audiences.\n\n**Sequence** steps are the individual messages and activities you design for your team to successfully engage with prospects. **Sequences** are made up of as many steps and with as much time between each step as you choose. An ideal outreach campaign requires multiple touches and interactions. You first need to decide upon the type of sales strategy that you want to implement. Is the purpose of your **sequence** to create demand, to generate pipeline, or to expand upon your existing business? This decision will influence whether you decide to follow an inbound, outbound, nurture-based, event-inspired, upselling, or other sales strategy. Depending on the approach that you choose, the number of steps in your **sequence** will vary. In most cases, Apollo recommends you follow up with someone at least 5 times.\n\nStep by Step\n\nFor more information about the types of steps available in Apollo, please refer to the \"[Available Steps in a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview#toc_2)\" section of the \"Sequences Overview\" article.

However, Apollo strongly recommends adopting an omnichannel selling strategy to engage your users with multiple touches across a number of the most common channels that they interact with daily.\n\nEmail is a powerful sales tool. When done correctly, sales emails can help you raise awareness, build rapport, and convert qualified leads into sales opportunities at scale. There are several best practices you can follow to increase your email conversion rates:\n\n*   Understand the pain points of your target audience\n*   Make it personal\n*   Create intrigue in the subject line\n*   Keep it simple and concise\n*   Include a powerful CTA\n*   Add multiple touch-points\n*   Learn when and how to link\n*   Avoid SPAM triggers in your email content\n*   A/B test\n\nWhen you have brainstormed your messaging strategy, add the messages into the **sequence** you created earlier.\n\nLaunch Apollo, click **Engage**, and then click **Sequences**.\n\n[![Engage-Sequences](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i1.png)\n\nOpen the **sequence** that you created earlier.\n\n[![Click Sequence](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i2.png)\n\nClick the email step that you want to edit.\n\n[![Click Email Step](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i3.png)\n\nSpecify the type of email, add the subject line, and copy your message into the body of the template.\n\n[![Create Template](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i4.png)\n\nRemember to take full advantage of [Apollo Snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813-Use-Basic-Snippets) to keep your automated messages personalized.\n\nClick the **Save as a new template** checkbox if you want to save and use this template in other **sequences**. Then, give your template a name.\n\n[![Save as a template](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i5.png)\n\nContemplating Templates?\n\nPlease note, you do not have to save your message as a template; however, there are advantages of doing so. For example, you can access template analytics, collaborate and share successful templates with team members, and update templates en masse. For more information about Apollo templates, please refer to the \"[Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409238165389-Create-and-Edit-Email-Templates)\" article.\n\nClick **Save Changes**.\n\n[![Save Changes](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i6.png)\n\nApollo saves your message. Repeat this process until you have added the copy for each email in your **sequence**.\n\n[![Messages Saved in Sequence](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i7.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Add Contacts to Your Sequence[](#toc_11)\n\nNow that you have your messages at the ready, it's time to add your **contacts**.\n\nThere are 3 different ways to add **contacts** to a **sequence** in Apollo. You can use the Apollo **Search** tool, upload a CSV file, or select **contacts** from a list.\n\nIt's Your Way or the Highway\n\nYou can choose to add **contacts** in the way that best suits you and your team. For more information about the steps to take for each, please refer to the \"[Add Contacts to a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence)\" article.\n\nOnce you have added your **contacts**, remember to activate the **sequence**. Click the toggle on the top right of the screen and check that you have activated the toggles on the left of each step.\n\n[![Activate Toggles](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i8.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Test, Analyze, and Improve[](#toc_12)\n\nYour **sequence** is now live, but the journey to achieving a successful sales campaign has only just begun! If you are serious about achieving long-term success through your email strategy in Apollo, you need to use the tools and data at your disposal to drive smart decision-making.\n\nTo ensure you are constantly improving your **sequences** and achieving optimal results, you can leverage 2 key components of the Apollo **Engagement** tool:\n\n*   A/B Testing\n*   Analytics\n\n### A/B Test[](#toc_13)\n\n**A/B testing** allows you to test multiple messages in a **sequence** step. Apollo sends an even traffic distribution to each message variant in the test.\n\n[![A/B Test](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i4.png)\n\nThere are several advantages of **A/B testing**:\n\n*   Determine which messages best engage which prospects.\n*   Better reach your intended audience through data-driven trial and error.\n*   Leverage the data from your A/B tests to improve the effectiveness of future messages and increase conversions.\n*   Reduce bounce rates by eliminating techniques that don't work well on your target audience.\n\nFor more information about the recommended sales metrics to aim for when starting out, please refer to the \"[Build an Outbound Sales Metric](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120718002701-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Metrics)\" article.\n\nTo set up **A/B testing** in Apollo, follow the instructions in the \"[Add an A/B Test to an Email Step in a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597-Add-an-A-B-Test-to-an-Email-Step-in-a-Sequence)\" article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Access Sequence Analytics[](#toc_14)\n\nWith your **sequence(s)** live and your **A/B testing** underway, it's time to leverage the Apollo **Analytics** tool. Apollo **Analytics** provides you with the insights that you need to identify key trends and define what is and isn\u2019t working. You can also use the data to decide which tests to run and which improvements to make to repeatedly smash your monthly and yearly targets on a consistent basis.\n\nWhen you send emails in Apollo, you can track your **Open**, **Click**, and **Response** rates.\n\n[![Sequence Analytics](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i11.png)\n\nTo access this data directly from within the **sequence** you created, please refer to the \"[Access Apollo Email Analytics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4425592135821-Access-Apollo-Email-Analytics-)\" article for step by step guidance.\n\nFrom the **Reports** tab in a **sequence**, you can also gain a deeper understanding of how your emails are performing across the different audience and company attributes.\n\n[![Sequence Reports Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_case_engagement_email/i12.png)\n\nTo gain a more holistic view of all your campaign data, you can leverage the Apollo **Analytics** tool.

Apollo updates the contact to the Interested stage automatically if your contact's email is detected in a Gmail calendar invitation. This only works when you have your Gmail account linked and you use Google Calendar. |\n| Not Interested | The contact responded that they are not interested. You can try to re-engage with the contact at a later date if they fit your buyer profile. |\n| Unresponsive | Apollo marks a contact as Unresponsive if they never reply or engage with your messaging. If you want to amend the default number of days in which Apollo marks a contact as unresponsive, refer to [Create Sequence Rulesets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509). You might want to re-engage with these leads every 30-90 days, as different positioning, more education about your product, a change in a contact's role, or better timing could still lead to a sale. |\n| Do Not Contact | Apollo automatically assigns a contact to the **Do Not Contact** stage if a contact actively unsubscribes from your emails. You can also [configure contact triggers](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/6134748003725) in the settings if you want to set up additional automation.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nIt Depends on Your Plan\n\nOpen tracking is only available on certain plans. For a breakdown of the features available in each Apollo plan, please refer to [the pricing page](https://www.apollo.io/pricing#compare). If you want to upgrade your plan to access open tracking, please reach out to the friendly [Apollo sales team](https://apollo.na.chilipiper.com/router/sales_router?leadsource=Inbound&lead_source_details__c=KnowledgeBase) for further assistance.\n\nEmail tracking systems, which inform you when your emails are opened, use a 1-pixel image called a tracking pixel to obtain interaction data. Each tracking pixel contains individualized code to attribute to the recipient and to the email that they receive. Additionally, if the recipient downloads the image, Apollo also logs it as an email open event.\n\nPixel Tracking Image URL\n\nApollo's tracking pixel is hosted on Heroku, so that pixel displays as a Heroku URL.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Open Tracking Considerations[](#toc_2)\n\nSometimes, email tracking systems mark an email as opened when they are not actually opened. The following scenarios cause false positives:\n\n*   In Outlook, the recipient can view the email from the preview pane.\n    *   This causes the tracking pixel to download even though they didn't actually click on the email.\u00a0\n*   The email recipient has a Google or G Suite address\n    *   As Google always proxies every link in an email, they may visit the link as a test. This can trigger an open event without the recipient ever reading the email. It is not a guaranteed outcome, but it is possible.\n*   On mobile, the Gmail app displays the email on a preview screen.\n    *   This sometimes triggers an email open event without the user seeing more than just the subject and first few words.\n\nOn the other hand, false negatives are also possible. This occurs when a contact opened your email and the tracking pixel was not downloaded so it did not trigger an open event. If your contact has set their email to not download images automatically, you may get incomplete data.\n\nThe easiest way to combat this and improve your open data is to include a clickable link in your email. This ensures that anyone who clicked your link opened and read your message.\n\nTry Turning it Off and On Again!\n\nPlease note, if you make changes to an active sequence, you need to turn it off and then on again to activate the changes.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Enhance Open Rates with A/B Testing[](#toc_3)\n\nA/B Testing helps to increase your open rates. By sending multiple versions of the same email, you can analyze the data to discover which version the recipients find most engaging. Use this data to tweak your messaging and enhance your open rates.\n\nRead [Add an A/B Test to an Email Step in a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597) for more information.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Low Open Rate Concerns[](#toc_4)\n\nMore often than not, low open rates for your emails are the direct result of bad deliverability and issues with your domain's reputation.\n\nSome email providers may report emails as successfully delivered, but instead, move them to a contact's SPAM folder. That means a contact never actually viewed or opened the email. If a contact doesn't view your email, open rates remain low.\n\nTo help avoid emails blocked by SPAM filters, please see the [Avoid SPAM Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885) article to review Apollo's suggestions for improving your domain's reputation.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410838798349-Open-Tracking-Overview"}

We are constantly working to improve the usability of Apollo for you and your team.\n\nIf you're not sure whether an email is good enough to send, use Apollo's AI email analyzer to rate your emails for reading time, reading level, clarity, and structure. This helps ensure that you optimize your emails for engagement and send messages that your prospects want to open and read.\n\nTo analyze emails before you send them, click **Analyze**. You should strive for a score of 90+ to increase your reply rate.\n\n[![Give the Apollo AI instructions for editing.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i71.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i70.png)\n\nIf Apollo's email analyzer marks an email as not ready to send, review each suggestion and implement the advice. Then, click **Refresh score**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Use Personalized Email Openers[](#toc_5)\n\nPersonalization is a key component of [successful email messaging](https://www.apollo.io/files/cold-email-deliverability-checklist.pdf). When you enable AI-generated personalized openers for emails, Apollo tailors the opener of each message to the specific events or information most relevant to each contact. This helps grab their attention, build rapport, and increase the likelihood of a response while significantly reducing your research time.\n\nDepending on the data available for a contact, there are several types of personalized openers that Apollo generates, including:\n\n*   **Company mission**: Speak to contacts on their level with openers tailored to their core company goals and values.\n*   **Current role**: Meet contacts where they are at with openers that relate to their current position within a company.\n*   **Upcoming anniversary**: Build rapport by anticipating upcoming milestones.\n*   **Job focus**: Tailor the start of your message to the specific areas that contacts care most about.\n*   **Solution focus**: Focus on resolving your recipient's pain points.\n*   **Work history**: Mention your recipient's past work experience.\n*   **Work anniversary**: Show you've done your research with timely openers that touch on a recent anniversary.\n\nIf you've [set up signals](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/13152837789837), Apollo also generates signal-based openers for individual emails.\n\nThe following tabs walk through how to generate and use personalized openers for both individual emails and emails in a sequence.\n\nTo add personalized openers to an individual email, click **Generate** > **Email opener**. [![Generate personalized openers for the contact.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i77.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i77.png)Find the opener that you want to use, then click the **copy** icon and paste the text into your email.

Apollo hopes to bring you a solution with polyglot powers in the future, but language learning takes time, so sit back and enjoy the English version for now.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Track Your AI Word Usage[](#toc_6)\n\nWant More Words?\n\nYour Apollo plan determines how many words you can generate with the AI writing assistant. Please refer to [**Apollo's pricing page**](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) for specific word counts by plan. All the words generated by Apollo AI per user count towards your monthly limit. This includes all the words in the email copy and personalized opener options that Apollo generates for you. Unused AI words do not roll over from 1 monthly billing cycle to the next, so make sure your team takes advantage of Apollo AI from the start of each billing cycle.\n\nWant to increase the number of words your team can generate per month? Click **Request Upgrade** from the [the AI history settings in Apollo](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/ai-history).\n\nTo track the number of AI words you and your team use, launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**AI Word Usage**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/ai-history). From here, you can view how many AI words your team has generated within the current billing cycle and the date when the word count will reset.\n\n[![Review the team's AI word usage.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the__ai_writing_assistant_in_your_emails/i6.png)\n\nThe **Team's AI word usage history** section also shows the number of AI words generated per user in your team and the date they were generated.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nEmail is a powerful sales tool. When done correctly, sales emails can help you raise awareness, build rapport and convert qualified leads into sales opportunities at scale. There are several best practices you can follow to increase your email conversion rates.\n\nRefer to the steps below to learn how to write effective sales emails.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand the Pain Points of Your Target Audience[](#toc_2)\n\nEvery 60 seconds, around [197.6 million emails](https://www.allaccess.com/assets/img/content/merge/2021/m-4-13-pic2.jpg) are sent. Before you write a sales email, ask yourself 3 important questions:\n\n*   What challenges are your ideal customers facing?\n*   How can you help them overcome their biggest challenges?\n*   Why should they care about what you have to say?\n\nYou need to speak in your ideal customer's language, focus each email on one of their biggest needs or concerns, and ensure you provide content of value. Make sure you answer relevant questions in the content of your emails. Your readers need to be able to identify the reason for your email right away.\n\nTurn generic terms, such as \"better\" and \"faster\" into specific outcomes, such as \"our company can increase sales by 20%.\" The more relevant, specific, and quantifiable your statements are, the more impactful your messages will be.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Make It Personal[](#toc_3)\n\nIt is only when you fully understand the needs and concerns of your ideal customers that you can personalize your emails effectively. Before you write a single message, you first need to segment your customers into smaller groups that share the same key characteristics and challenges.\n\nFollow the recommendations below to reach the right audience, with the right message, at the right time:\n\n*   Set the goals for your campaign(s) and decide the parameters by which you will segment your ideal customers.\n    \n*   Use [Search Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview) when prospecting to find the specific contacts and accounts that fit your criteria for a certain campaign.\n    \n*   Create your key [Buyer Personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona), identify their defining characteristics and determine their biggest pain points. This information should frame the content of the emails in every sequence.\n    \n*   [Build Lists](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409728608525-Create-and-Edit-a-Contact-or-Company-List) to segment your target contacts and accounts into the appropriate categories.\n    \n*   [Create Sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101-Create-a-Sequence) with highly targeted messaging that speaks directly to each of your buyer persona's specific needs.\n    \n*   Use [Sequence Statistics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233647373-Sequence-Statistics-Overview) to analyze and refine your segmentation tactics and further personalize your approach.\n    \n\nWhen you are ready to write your emails, let your audience know that you see and hear them. Speak to their needs by making your messages relatable, personalized, and clear.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create Intrigue in the Subject Line[](#toc_4)\n\nSubject lines hold the key to high open rates. Keep it short, create intrigue, and make it personal.\n\n*   **Length**: Try to capture your message in as few words as possible. Between 10 and 60 characters is ideal.\n*   **Intrigue**: Leave your reader wanting more. Relate to their key interests or concerns, offer value, and create a fear of loss.\n*   **Personalization**: Avoid generic terms and phrases. Instead, use {{company}} snippets to personalize your approach and give your emails a more human touch.\n\nSubject Line Taboo\n\nAlthough personalization is important, try to stay away from first name snippets in the subject line. While {{company}} name snippets tend to increase open rates, email servers often flag as SPAM any subject lines that include {{first\\_name}} snippets.\n\nHere are some examples of effective subject lines:\n\n*   Idea for {{company}}\n*   {{company}} + \\[Your Company Name\\]\n*   How competitive is {{company}}\u2019s _Sales_ team?\n*   10x {{company}}\u2019s traction in 10 minutes\n*   Question about _Employee Loyalty_ at {{company}}\n\nA/B Test with Apollo\n\nPlease note, every industry, niche, and target audience is different. Follow best practices as a starting point, but make sure you [A/B Test](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597-Add-an-A-B-Test-to-an-Email-Step-in-a-Sequence) your subject lines to improve your open rates and uncover what works best for your specific niche.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Keep it Simple and Concise[](#toc_5)\n\nAttention spans are short so be concise and get straight to the point. Your ideal customers are not interested in your life story. They want to know why your message is beneficial to them. If they don't see value immediately, your email will end up in the trash folder. So keep to one focal point per email and make your message digestible.\n\nSimplicity is also key in sales emails. You need to strike a balance between approachable, casual, and informative. Don't overcomplicate or provide too much detail. Keep your emails clean, concise, and conversational. Avoid bullet points and heavy punctuation, make your point clear, and provide just enough value to spark their interest and leave them wanting more.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Include A Powerful CTA[](#toc_6)\n\nA CTA (Call-to-Action) is a question, link, or button that draws immediate attention to the offer or focus of your email and encourages the reader to take action.\n\nCTAs should be easy to spot, action-oriented, thoughtful, and persuasive.\n\nFollow the tactics below to engage with your readers and encourage a response:\n\n*   Mention a specific time or date to make it easier for your contact to commit to a meeting. For example:\n\nAre you available for a call on {{now\\_weekday->plus\\_1}} \nor {{now\\_weekday->plus\\_2}}?\"\n\nCan you touch base on a call this week?\n\nLet's talk. How does this {{now\\_weekday->plus\\_1}} work \nfor you, {{first\\_name}}?\n\n*   Be polite but persistent:\n\nHave you given any thought to my last email, \n{{first\\_name}}?\n\nAre you still the best person to talk to about \n\\[topic\\]? If not, who would you recommend I speak to?\n\nWhat are your thoughts about the proposal?\n\n*   Be helpful:\n\nDo you have any questions at all?\n\nWant me to run you through your options?\n\nDoes it still make sense for us to sync up?\n\n*   Give context:\n\nCan I share a \\[short video\\] about \n\\[overcoming related pain point\\], {{first\\_name}}?\n\n[Click here](https://www.apollo.io/) to discover, engage, and convert your ideal \ncustomers.\n\nGot 15 minutes to talk about \\[topic\\]?\n\n*   Add Urgency:\n\nSign up now.\n\nHow much time does it currently take your team to do \n\\[X task\\]?\n\nReply by EOW to receive your discount.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Add Multiple Touchpoints[](#toc_7)\n\nEvery point of contact that you make in a campaign is a touchpoint. This refers to email, LinkedIn, call, voicemail, SMS, etc. The ideal number of touchpoints that you should make per contact in any given campaign will vary depending on the type of buyer personas, the stage they are in the sales cycle, and the specific industries with which you engage.\n\nNo matter the circumstances, don't give up after the first hurdle. You need to nurture your prospects, provide valuable content, and have confidence in your approach. Remember the reason why you are contacting your ideal customers and the value that your product or services can bring to them.\n\nTouch Points\n\nOn average, 5-8 touches is a good place to start\u2014provided you segment your leads correctly and share a clear, valuable message with every touch. Don't forget to A/B Test though. Analyzing the data will help you to find the ideal number of touchpoints for each specific campaign you run.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Learn When And How To Link[](#toc_8)\n\nIn an outbound campaign, you start as a stranger to those whom you are contacting. You need to build trust and prove that your message is worth the readers' time before you can expect them to click on any content you send.\n\nIf you want your readers to open the links you share, provide context and entice them. Use short, action-oriented CTAs and give them a rough idea of what they will gain from clicking. Refer to the example below:\n\n[Click here](https://www.apollo.io/customers/coder/) to find out how Coder achieved a 50x ROI \nwithin one month using Apollo.\n\nAvoid SPAM\n\nPlease note, you should keep the number of links down to 1 or 2 maximum per email or your bounce rate may rise. In the first touch email, it's very important to avoid sending any links, attachments, or images as the recipient's server is more likely to flag you as SPAM.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Avoid SPAM Triggers in Your Email Content[](#toc_9)\n\nTo improve delivery rates and avoid email servers flagging your sales emails as SPAM, there are several content best practices that you can follow:\n\n*   Try not to over-promise or sensationalize the information in your emails. Avoid words and phrases such as cost, payment, earn, buy direct, and make money.\n\nSPAM Trigger Words\n\nFor a more detailed list of words and phrases to avoid in your emails, refer to this [HubSpot Article](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30684/the-ultimate-list-of-email-spam-trigger-words.aspx).\n\n*   Remove unnecessary links from the body of your email and your signature. It's especially important to avoid links in a first-touch email.\n    \n*   Do not include images or attachments in the body of your email unless it is 100% necessary. Again, this is especially important in first-touch emails.\n    \n*   Keep your paragraphs concise. Long content can activate SPAM blockers.\n    \n*   A/B test your messaging to discover which versions of your emails have the lowest bounce rate.\n    \n\nAvoid SPAM Filters\n\nPlease refer to the [Avoid SPAM Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-SPAM-Filters) article for a more comprehensive look at how to improve the delivery rates for the emails that you send through Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## A/B Test[](#toc_10)\n\nWhat works for others may not work for you and your target audience. The best way to determine the most effective sales messaging for your campaigns is to let the data do the talking. A/B Testing allows you to test multiple messages in a sequence step. With more than one email template per step, you can analyze and leverage the data to tweak your messaging and improve the effectiveness of future emails.\n\n[Back to top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415045401485-How-Do-I-Write-Effective-Sales-Emails"}

[![Example sequences are toggled on](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i1.png)\n\n### Activate the Sequence Steps[](#toc_4)\n\nEnsure you activated the sequence step associated with the email you expected to send. To activate sequence steps:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Engage** > [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n2.  Click the sequence that you need to review.\n3.  Toggle the sequence steps on. [![Example sequence steps are toggled on](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i2.png)\n\n### Verify Wait Time Between Steps[](#toc_5)\n\nCheck the wait time between each sequence step associated with the email you expected to send. To verify wait time:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Engage** > [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n2.  Click the sequence that you need to review.\n3.  Check the wait time shown to the right of each step. Apollo won't send your contacts any emails until this time has passed. [![An example wait time is highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i3.png)\n4.  To edit the wait time, click \\[**. . .**\\] > **Edit**. [![The ellipsis button is clicked with Edit highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i4.png)\n5.  Use the **When to start this step** option to adjust the wait time between steps. [![The when to start wait time is highlighted with 1 hour set](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i5.png)\n6.  When finished, click **Continue**.\n\n### An Email Requires Manual Review[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you configure a manual email step in a sequence, the email won't send automatically. You need to send the email manually:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Engage** > [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n2.  Click the sequence that you need to review.\n3.  Click **Tasks**. [![The Task tab is highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i6.png)\n4.  Then click the **Email**. [![An example email is highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/why_didn't_my_email_send/i7.png)\n5.  Personalize the email for the contact, then click **Schedule**. Choose whether to send the email immediately or schedule delivery for later.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Apollo Sent Your Emails, But They Failed to Deliver[](#toc_7)\n\nIf Apollo sent your emails but they failed to deliver, use [deliverability scoring](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/23432467200781-Improve-Your-Email-Deliverability#toc_1)) to confirm your mailbox's deliverability rating. If your deliverability scores are good, there are 3 possible causes for email delivery issues:\n\n*   [The email bounced.](#toc_8)\n*   [The emails haven't been sent.](#toc_9)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Bounced Emails[](#toc_8)\n\nIf an email bounces, it means that the recipient's email address no longer exists or there's an error in the recipient's information. When this happens, the email is returned and the email status is updated to _Bounced_.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Not Sent[](#toc_9)\n\nIf you tried the troubleshooting steps in this article, but you're still having issues with emails not delivering, check out the following table for possible solutions:\n\n| Reason | Explanation | Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Blocked Contact Stage | When you create a sequence, you have the option to mark emails as `Not Sent` when a contact is in a selected contact stage through a [sequence ruleset](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509-Create-Sequence-Rulesets). If you then try to send an email to a contact in one of the selected stages, Apollo won't send the email. | You can change the stage of a contact that you want to email, or you can change the settings in the [sequence ruleset](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509-Create-Sequence-Rulesets) so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to contacts in the stage. After making this change, try sending the email again. |\n| Blocked Account Stage | When you create a sequence, you have the option to mark emails as `Not Sent` when an account is in a selected account stage through a [sequence ruleset](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509-Create-Sequence-Rulesets). If you try to send an email to an account that is in one of the selected stages, Apollo won't send the email. | You can change the stage of a specific account that you want to email, or you can change the settings in the [sequence ruleset](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509-Create-Sequence-Rulesets) so that Apollo no longer blocks emails to any accounts in the stage. After making this change, try sending the email again. |\n| Same Account Replied | If you set a sequence rule not to send when another contact from the same account replies in any sequence, Apollo won't send the email. | Update the settings in the [sequence ruleset](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396858509-Create-Sequence-Rulesets), then send the email again. |\n| Unverified Email | If it's your first time sending an email to a contact with an unverified email, Apollo won't send the email as a failsafe. | Unverified emails have a 60-80% success rate. Try sending the email again. |\n| Missing Snippet | If you include [snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093-Create-and-Edit-Snippets) in a message and the contact you want to email doesn't have a value for the snippet, Apollo won't send the email. | Edit the contact's profile to add a value for the missing field. Alternatively, change the [snippet](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093-Create-and-Edit-Snippets) to an [advanced snippet](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Snippets) and add a fallback for this type of scenario. |\n| Missing Dynamic Variable | If you used [dynamic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813-Use-Basic-Dynamic-Variables) in a message and the contact you want to email doesn't have a value for a dynamic variable, Apollo won't send the email. | To fix the issue, edit the contact's profile to add a value for the missing field. Alternatively, change the dynamic variable to an [advanced dynamic variable](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables) and add a fallback for this type of scenario. |\n| Missing Thread Info | If you set the email type as \"Reply to a Previous Thread\" and the contact deletes the previous email, Apollo won't send the email. | You can send this contact a manual email. To ensure the next emails in the sequence are sent, adjust any other emails in the sequence to send as part of a new thread. |\n| No Send From Mailbox Selected | When you add contacts to a sequence, you must assign a mailbox. If one of your teammates removes a mailbox to which you linked your contacts in the sequence, Apollo won't send the email. | You can update an existing mailbox or [link the sequence to another mailbox](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411178322573-Update-a-Linked-Mailbox-in-a-Sequence). |\n| Email Missing or Invalid | If you added a contact with no email address to your sequence, Apollo won't send the email. | Update the email address on the contact's profile. When the information is up-to-date, resend the message. |\n| Contact Account Not Owned by User | You might only have permissions to send emails to the contacts you own. If you try to email another user's contact or account, Apollo won't send the email. | Re-assign ownership of the contact, or ask an Apollo admin to [change your permissions](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409154208269-Create-Permission-Profiles#toc_5) so you can send emails to other users' contacts and accounts. |\n| Email Service Provider Error | If a contact's email server is unable to deliver the email and returns an error to Apollo, Apollo can't send the message. | Hover your mouse over the \"Email Service Provider Error\" in Apollo to find out more about the error. Use this information to troubleshoot email delivery, or reach out to [Apollo Support](https://www.apollo.io/submit-a-request). |\n| Other | If an email fails to deliver for any other reason, Apollo shows an `Other` error. | Reach out to [Apollo Support](https://www.apollo.io/submit-a-request) for assistance. |\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Apollo Has Not Attempted to Send Your Emails[](#toc_10)\n\nIf Apollo hasn't tried to send your emails, there are 2 possible reasons for this:\n\n*   An admin in your team has deleted the user associated with the contacts in your sequence. To solve this issue, you need to re-assign ownership of the contacts, and then send the email again.\n*   The time or date you scheduled the email to send has already passed. To solve this issue, [edit the send time](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5403737512589-Why-Didn-t-My-Email-Send-#toc_5) for the step.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Resend an Email[](#toc_11)\n\nAfter you've diagnosed a delivery issue, send the email again:\n\n1.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nCold calling enables you to connect with prospects who might not engage in other channels. Leading sales experts show that [dialing prospects is one of the fastest ways to book meetings](https://www.apollo.io/magazine/the-cold-calling-framework-that-earned-charlotte-lloyd-15m-in-outbound-sales).\n\nCheck Your Plan\n\nThe availability of certain features that are useful in cold calling is subject to your Apollo plan. Refer to Apollo's [pricing page](https://www.apollo.io/pricing) for more details.\n\nThe following sections outline some general best practices for cold calling with Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Filter Prospects[](#toc_1)\n\nThoroughly filtering contacts before cold calling increases the likelihood that you are dialing qualified prospects. There are several ways to narrow your list of cold call candidates in Apollo:\n\n*   Target [recommended contacts](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20747906147853). Apollo provides these contacts based on the [personas you create](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona), which means they likely match the criteria you seek.\n*   Use demographics [search filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661). You can apply multiple filters to your contact searches, including job titles, locations, company size, and revenue. Utilize search filters to identify prospects that match your [ideal customer profile (ICP)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416471135245).\n*   Use the **Phone Status/Confidence** search filter. With this filter, you can search your [saved contacts](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409803718669) to find those with valid phone numbers. This is particularly useful when you have \\[added your saved contacts to a sequence\\](#incorporate-cold-calling-into-a-larger-strategy).\n*   Add [buying intent topics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8135721478925). Buying intent helps you understand which companies are actively researching topics related to your product.\n*   Identify [website visitors](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20544185285389). Track companies that visit your websites by adding an Apollo-provided JavaScript snippet, then filter prospects based on whether they have visited your web properties.\n*   Avoid [high-risk phone numbers](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/21289989032717). Apollo warns you if you attempt to purchase a high-risk number. Excluding contacts with these numbers from your cold calling strategy improves your call quality and prevents your number from being marked as spam. However, you should not rule out these leads entirely, so consider adding them to an emails-only sequence.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Script Your Calls[](#toc_2)\n\nCold calls typically last less than a few minutes, and unscripted conversation can leave a prospect feeling you weren't prepared to talk with them. To ensure your calls are successful, you will want to prepare some general dialogue.\n\nBefore you dial, write and rehearse a short cold calling script like the following example that you can use both for live calls and voicemails. Try to use your own voice and make the dialogue sound natural, but adhere to the general structure. Don't make your script too complicated. The goal of a cold call is to connect briefly with a prospect and move them to a more formal meeting.\n\n**The Opener**\n\nThe first 10 seconds of your call should be used to ask for their attention for the next 30 seconds-2 minutes so you can introduce the topic of the call.\n\nHi \\[PROSPECT\u2019S NAME\\], this is \\[YOUR NAME\\] from \\[YOUR COMPANY\\]. How have you been?\n\nI know we didn't plan this call. Do you mind if quickly walk you through why I called,  \n and you can let me know if you think it's worth a follow-up call?\n\n**The Hook**\n\nIf they agree to continue the conversation, the next 30 seconds-2 minutes should be used to introduce the topic and engage in a short exchange to uncover their pain points. Draw attention to the prospect's role and company so they know you are targeting them, not just pitching anyone that answers your calls.\n\nI noticed that you are the head of \\[PROSPECT'S ROLE\\] at \\[PROSPECT'S COMPANY\\]. \n\nI want to introduce \\[YOUR COMPANY/PRODUCT\\]. It can provide \\[VALUE PROPOSITION\\] to   \nyour company.\n\n**The Close**\n\nEnd the call with an accepted next step. Ideally, this will be a scheduled 15-30 minutes to more thoroughly discuss the pain points that you uncovered.\n\nDo you think \\[YOUR PRODUCT\\] could be helpful in solving your team's challenges in 2024?  \n\\[WAIT FOR PROSPECT'S ANSWER\\]\n\nGreat! Let's put down 30 minutes on your calendar for a walkthrough. How does your   \ncalendar look over the next week?\n\nFor more cold call scripting inspiration, refer to [6 Winning Cold Calling Scripts that Actually Book Meetings](https://www.apollo.io/magazine/6-winning-cold-call-scripts-that-actually-book-meetings) To learn more about cold calling generally, check out the [How to Build Pipeline with Cold Calling](https://www.apollo.io/academy/perfecting-the-cold-call) lesson in Apollo Academy.\n\nBook Me!\n\nHave a prospect that wants to move forward? Set up [meetings](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803371030) in Apollo to make it quick and easy to book time on your calendar. You can email the prospect a link that enables them to select an available time slot based on the rules you set.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Leave Voicemails[](#toc_3)\n\nWhen cold calls are not answered, [leaving a voicemail](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/26012750878605) is standard practice. Voicemails signal to contacts that they are important to you, and that you are a real person making a genuine attempt to connect.\n\nAs with a cold call, you should also script your voicemails to both make your voicemails more effective and to stand out against competitors. A well-scripted voicemail serves as a high-quality touch in the sales process, and is more likely to lead to callbacks from contacts. Your cold call script can serve as the basis for your voicemail script.\n\nAlso, do not fear dialing personal mobile numbers instead of office numbers when leaving voicemails. Assuming you [adhere to regulations](#toc_5), many sales experts experience more success dialing personal numbers, especially with hybrid and remote work arrangements on the rise.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Practice Objection Handling[](#toc_4)\n\nContacts have reasons why they are not interested in hearing more about your product, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are not good prospects. Better objection handling enables you to move calls beyond typical prospect objections and book more meetings.\n\nTo improve your objection handling skills:\n\n*   Practice your responses to the most common objections you'll hear on cold calls.

Caller reputation is effectively a scoring system that determines whether your calls are at risk of being screened or blocked as spam and helps you maintain a positive caller reputation. The calls made by a phone number determine the caller reputation. To maintain a positive caller reputation, Apollo recommends:\n\n*   Check the [US Do Not Call Registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/) and the UK Telephone Preference Service (TPS), and avoid calling numbers on these lists unless you have a permitted reason. Enable [DNC list screening](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19207906524557) in Apollo to help you stay compliant.\n*   Remove outdated/disconnected phone numbers from your call list. Additionally, if Apollo has notified you that a contact has requested to be removed from the Apollo database, you should not contact them unless you have a separate legal basis to do so.\n*   Keep your outbound call volume steady, and ramp up outbound call volume gradually. Unusual spikes in volume can lead to a number being marked as spam.\n*   Make calls within common working hours for the area you are dialing, and do not repeatedly dial the same phone number.\n\nYou should also comply with the following regulations:\n\n*   [TCPA rules](https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/tcpa-rules.pdf): The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) outlines several rules that businesses must follow when contacting consumers via phone. The TCPA includes restrictions around telemarketing, such as requiring express written consent from prospects before making telemarketing calls with automated dialers or artificial or prerecorded messages, among other regulations.\n*   [FCC regulations](https://www.fcc.gov/): The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is a US government agency that regulates a variety of communications, including phone communications. The FCC provides tips to consumers that want to [avoid robocalls and scams](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-robocalls-and-texts), which means you can use the same tips to avoid being considered spam. For example, do not ask a prospect for personal information, do not pressure them, and use known phone numbers to make calls.\n*   [Twilio Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/aup): Apollo\u2019s provider\u2019s policy outlines several rules regarding call content, prohibited activities, and other restrictions that you should follow when cold calling.\n\nYou are responsible for ensuring that any cold call you make from the Apollo dialer is compliant with the law.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Analyze Call Performance[](#toc_6)\n\nApollo provides an analytics dashboard that details call performance across the team:\n\n*   **Frontline sales reps and AEs**: Identify the reps that make the most effective calls, then listen to recordings of their calls to learn how to improve.\n*   **Sales leaders**: Determine which types of contacts are engaging with your team's calls, then adjust your strategy to prioritize those types of contacts. Also, use this data to perform A/B testing across the team. For example, provide a call script to half the team and a different call script to the other half, then review the data to determine which script performs better.\n\nTo access this data, launch Apollo and click [**Analytics**](https://app.apollo.io/#/analytics), then click the **Call engagement performance** dashboard.\n\n[![Access analytics dashboard.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/cold_calling_best_practices/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/cold_calling_best_practices/i1.png)\n\nYou can also record calls with the Apollo [dialer](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140527757). To access recordings, launch Apollo and click [**Calls**](https://app.apollo.io/#/phone-calls).\n\nDifferent roles should utilize call recordings in different ways:\n\n*   **Frontline sales reps and AEs**: Listen to call recordings from high-performing teammates to glean cold-calling tips and improve your own call strategy.\n*   **Sales leaders**: Listen to recordings from across your sales teams to identify coaching opportunities for individual reps.\n\nSome US states and countries require that all call participants consent to recording calls, so Apollo recommends that you obtain this consent before using the recording functionality.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Incorporate Cold Calling Into A Larger Strategy[](#toc_7)\n\nMaking cold calls is just one aspect of a multi-touch, multi-channel sales strategy. Each prospect is more or less likely to engage based on your outreach method. That means, in addition to dialing, you should be engaging contacts via email, social media, and other avenues, with the goal of reaching contacts in where they are most likely to engage.\n\nBuilding a multi-channel sales strategy means keeping track of the various touchpoints being used to reach contacts. [Create sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101) in Apollo to plan and execute a multi-touch sales strategy, then add your contacts to a sequence. Sequences enable you to set the appropriate contact points and timing for specific types of prospects, then track and complete [tasks](https://app.apollo.io/#/tasks) for each contact from the same area of Apollo.\n\nBy using sequences, you can also access data to iterate your sales strategy. For example, [add A/B testing for your emails](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597) to better understand the types of content that your prospects prefer.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Learn More[](#toc_8)\n\nWant to become a master of cold calling?

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nThe most effective outreach strategies almost always include [phone calls](https://app.apollo.io/#/phone-calls). Engaging your prospects in meaningful conversation is a core component of [building quality pipeline](https://www.apollo.io/academy/perfecting-the-cold-call) and [converting leads](https://www.apollo.io/academy/how-to-win-more-deals-with-apollo). However, if you want your outreach strategy to succeed, you must follow calling best practices even before you dial.\n\nKnowing how to avoid high-risk numbers in your outreach is essential. Among other factors, it can help:\n\n*   Increase call quality.\n*   Prevent your number from being marked as spam.\n*   Reduce your number of dropped calls.\n\nRefer to the following sections for more information on high-risk numbers and the best practices you can follow to keep your dialing habits healthy.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Identify High-Risk Numbers[](#toc_2)\n\nHigh-risk numbers are the numbers you call with a higher probability of triggering low engagement, resulting in spam traps, and putting the health of your number at risk.\n\nThey typically include numbers such as:\n\n*   **Toll fraud risk numbers**: These numbers encourage spam calls and are often part of fraud schemes where the owners receive revenue for every minute of the call.\n*   **Special service numbers**: These numbers include premium, shared-cost, and other special service numbers. Owners often charge higher rates when the call connects.\n\nIf you dial these types of \"premium\", often fraudulent numbers in your outreach, you put the health and credibility of your number at risk, burn through phone credits, and experience a much lower call quality on the whole.\n\n### High-Risk Locations[](#toc_3)\n\nThere is no clear-cut list of countries you should avoid calling in your outreach. Most regions have at least some high-risk numbers. The level of risk in each location can also vary depending on which country you and your team are calling from.\n\nDespite this, Apollo is committed to helping you keep your caller reputation safe and avoid high-risk numbers within your outreach. Apollo partners with the industry-leading, third-party provider Twilio to integrate voice calls in Apollo.\n\nThrough a sophisticated analysis mechanism, which leverages anti-fraud databases and millions of communication data points, Twilio consistently identifies and updates a list of high-risk number ranges. Apollo monitors this list and deactivates risky regions to help protect your account.\n\n[![Unsupported countries badge](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i2.png)\n\n### Low Engagement[](#toc_4)\n\nMany varying factors influence the risk level of a number. Make sure you closely monitor your call performance and keep an eye on low engagement rates. If you notice any negative trends within specific regions, consider excluding said locations from your outreach entirely.\n\nIf your total addressable market is exclusive to a very narrow set of locations and excluding regions from your outreach is not an option, consider using a third-party validation tool to cross-check any numbers within locations where you've seen a low engagement rate.\n\nThe more you analyze your call data, take precautions, and adapt your strategy based on what is and isn't working for your team, the higher your engagement will be, and the less likely your numbers will fall victim to fraudulent spam traps.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Identify High-Risk Numbers in Apollo[](#toc_5)\n\nWhen Apollo identifies high-risk numbers, it informs you. This means that you can take action to exclude these numbers from your outreach and keep your calling reputation safe.\n\nThere are two scenarios in which Apollo warns you of high-risk numbers:\n\n1.  Before purchasing the contact's number when prospecting. [![Warning modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i5.png)\n2.  Before attempting to call the number from the dialer. [![High-risk badge in direct dial modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i6.png)\n\nIf you have already purchased the number, you can also see the high-risk badge:\n\n*   From a [contact's profile page](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5995459280525-Contact-Profile-Overview)\n*   From your [active tasks](https://app.apollo.io/#/tasks)\u2014if you've scheduled any upcoming calls to contacts with high-risk numbers.\n\nNobody Likes Spam!\n\nPlease keep in mind that the more high-risk numbers you call, the more likely your number will be marked as spam. Apollo strongly recommends you don't call high-risk numbers inside or outside of Apollo. Even if a number is enabled within the Apollo dialer, Apollo encourages you not to call the number unless it is absolutely necessary.\n\nApollo classifies high-risk numbers into 3 buckets:\n\nDialing Like a Boss!\n\nReady to get dialing but looking for industry-leading calling tips to help you and your team strengthen your pipeline? Check out [this video](https://www.apollo.io/academy/perfecting-the-cold-call) on perfecting the cold call for more guidance.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Leverage Apollo Features to Improve Your Connection Rates[](#toc_6)\n\n[![Analytics dashboard homepage](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/avoid_high_risk_numbers/i1.png)\n\nThere are several actions you can take in Apollo to help increase call engagement rates and avoid spam traps:\n\n1.  **Avoid calling high-risk numbers**: Apollo informs you when it [identifies a high-risk number](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/ADDLINKTOSECTIONABOVE). Heed the advice and consider contacting the prospect via another channel instead. You can create messaging-only [sequences](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences) and engage with these prospects via email and LinkedIn.\n2.  **Make VOIP calls**: Once you've configured [the dialer](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140527757-Configure-the-Dialer), make [Voice Over IP calls](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231421837-Make-and-Receive-VoIP-Calls) instead of using your phone. If you encounter any issues, switch to a new number. Depending on [your plan](https://www.apollo.io/pricing#compare), you can request up to 5 new numbers per month in Apollo. If you're calling contacts in [international regions](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409297562125-Countries-With-Available-International-Phone-Numbers), keep a close eye on performance per country and make changes to your strategy if you notice any negative trends.\n3.  **Follow best practices**: [Stay compliant](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140527757-Configure-the-Dialer%3EConfigure%20the%20Dialer#toc_5) and follow [caller best practices](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803371030-Recommendations-and-Best-Practices-for-Maintaining-a-Positive-Caller-Reputation) to maintain a positive reputation. Create and use [call purposes](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5065846644621-Use-Call-Purposes-to-Refine-Call-Reporting) and [call dispositions](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5494331315853-Create-Call-Dispositions-to-Log-Your-Calls) in Apollo to generate more precise data and [filter your calls](https://app.apollo.io/#/phone-calls) to more easily identify trends. Ensure you log all calls accurately and empower your team to follow suit.\n4.  **Leverage [Apollo analytics](https://app.apollo.io/#/analytics)**: Keep an eye on your recent call activity from [the control center](https://app.apollo.io/#/control-center), create [custom dashboards](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411230325517-Build-and-Access-Dashboards-In-Apollo) and [reports](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410826842381-Build-and-Access-Reports-In-Apollo) to monitor call performance, and tailor the data you gather according to your priorities. If you don't want to create a dashboard from scratch, you can also leverage the Apollo template: [Call Engagement Performance](https://app.apollo.io/#/analytics/dashboards/6095a711bd01d100a506d511) to view and analyze call engagement in your team. If you spot anomalies, take action to adapt your strategy, increase engagement rates, and protect your caller reputation.\n\n[Back to top](#top)\n\n## Try It Out In Apollo[](#toc_7)\n\nThere's No Time Like the Present!\n\nFeeling more confident about high-risk numbers and the steps you can take in Apollo to avoid those pesky digits in your sales outreach?

However, you don't want to spend valuable time repeatedly recording the same messages, and compromising on quality as you reach hundreds of dials in a day.\n\nInstead, record a standard set of voicemails in Apollo to make your outreach more efficient and effective. Then, drop the recordings at the end of your voice calls when there is no response. Instead of recording 100 voicemails a day at 30 seconds each, use that time for other high-impact activities while improving the quality of your voicemails.\n\nThe following sections show how to record your voicemail drops and use them when [dialing with Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140527757).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Record Voicemail Drops[](#toc_1)\n\nBefore recording voicemail drops, take time to script your voicemails in the same way you would [script your calls](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/23267261088653).

Documentation from outside of the country will result in rejection.\n\nOnce submitted, it may take up to 48 hours to verify your documentation.\n\n[![Application Submitted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i20.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i20.png)\n\nYou will receive an email once Twilio has processed your application.\n\n*   If your application is rejected, you should refer to the \"Common Reasons for Document Rejection\" callout above to update your documentation and resubmit your application.\n*   If your application is accepted, you can use the steps below to continue selecting an international phone number.\n\nLaunch Apollo and navigate to **Settings**.\n\n[![Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i1.png)\n\nClick **Voice** from the \"You\" section.\n\n[![Voice](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i2.png)\n\nClick **Choose a Number** to select a phone number option for the country for which you were approved.\n\n[![Application Submitted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i21.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i21.png)\n\nEnter the ISO Alpha-2 country code for the country you were approved and click **Search**.\n\n[![Search](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i22.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i22.png)\n\nSelect a phone number from the list and then click **\u2714 Choose Number**.\n\n[![Select Number](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i23.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i23.png)\n\nYour international phone number is now assigned to your Apollo account.\n\n[![Number Added](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i24.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_dialer/i24.png)\n\nWaiting Period\n\nPlease note, it may take an additional 24 hours for Apollo to confirm and allot your new phone number.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Configure Calls[](#toc_7)\n\n### Types of Calls[](#toc_8)\n\nThere are two types of call options you can configure for your outgoing and incoming calls, **Bridge** and **VoIP**.\n\n**Bridge** allows you to consolidate calls to your mobile device while retaining the ability to log and record them in Apollo. If you enable **Bridge** calls for outgoing or incoming phone calls, you must enter your personal phone number. **Bridge** calls are only available for US phone numbers. International dialing is not supported with **Bridge**.\n\n*   **Incoming Calls**: Contacts need to call your Apollo phone number for the call to be bridged to your personal phone number. Voicemails are left on your phone's mailbox, assuming that you have configured a voicemail box for your phone.\n*   **Outgoing Calls**: You will receive a call to your personal phone number from your Apollo number. This call will prompt you to complete the bridge by interacting with your dialer.

That\u2019s ok! If you aren\u2019t aware of the details you need to fill in your **Product Market Fit Canvas**, you should take a look at your current customer data. You can leverage this data to find patterns that you can then use to describe each of these segments.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n\n*   Is there a particular vertical that pops up frequently in your closed deals?\n*   Are there any trends related to the size of the companies who buy your product or service or their proximity to a funding round?\n*   Do the people that most frequently buy your product sit in a particular department or hold a specific title?\n\nPosing these kinds of questions helps you to find patterns in your customer data that you can use to fill in your **Product Market Fit Canvas** and reach out to the prospects who are most likely to buy.\n\nUltimately, what you\u2019re trying to do is discover your **[Ideal Customer Profile](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413044057741)** (ICP).

Each column or **Segment** in our **Product Market Fit Canvas** represents a different outreach campaign that we will create in the Apollo platform.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at **Segment A**. Here, we can see that \u201cSMB Startups\u201d are one type of company we should dig into. This description doesn\u2019t give us a specific vertical with which to start. However, it does tell us that we should be looking at companies with fewer than 1000 employees who are also in the early stages of their business. Perhaps they\u2019ve gone through a funding round in the last year or two. Once a company has raised its initial funding and has done two or more rounds of large venture capital or private equity investment, they\u2019re not typically considered a start-up anymore and we can rule out any company that meets that criteria.\n\nYou might be saying to yourself, \u201d_I\u2019ve got this information\u2014now what?_\u201d\n\nApollo offers numerous built-in targets to help you find the right people for your outbound campaigns. We have extensive documentation about each filter type available on the Apollo Knowledge Base:\n\n*   [**Search Filters Overview**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview)\n\nWe created an Apollo Search with filters that include a pre-defined range of **51-1000** for the number of employees and funding rounds of **Seed**, **Angel**, **Venture**, and **Series A**.\n\n[![Target](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i2.png)\n\nThis has given us a total of about 9,000 companies we can dig into. We\u2019ll create a **[Saved Search](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409803718669-Create-a-Saved-Search)** for these companies so we can come back to them later.\n\n[![Filters](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i3.png)\n\nNext, we need to utilize what we know about the people who are involved in our closed deals to further refine our search. In the interest of reusability and scalability, we can accomplish this by creating a [Persona](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona) for Founders at SMB Companies.\n\n[![Personas](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i4.png)\n\nWith our **[Persona](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona)** created, we\u2019ll return to the **Apollo Search** tool and load our **Saved Search** for **SMB Startups**.\n\n[![Saved Searches](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_target_real_buyers/i5.png)\n\nWe\u2019ll batch select some of the companies from our list.

As we mentioned in the **Setting the Scene** section, you should ask yourself a series of questions to help identify the types of companies and the people who work at them who are most likely to buy your product or service. Ask yourself the following questions and then use that information to fill in your **Product Market Fit Canvas:**\n\n*   What industries or verticals do your customers most frequently belong to?\n*   What is the average company size for your current customers?\n*   What do the technology stacks look like for your customers? Are there any similarities between the companies that you\u2019ve closed?\n*   Does geography play a factor in the deals that you\u2019ve closed? For instance, are most of your customers based in Latin America?\n*   Do any of the roles for your current customers appear more often than others?\n*   What title seniorities are most frequently involved in your closed deals?\n\nGot To Start Somewhere!\n\nThese questions are only a starting point. You shouldn\u2019t shy away from digging into your data to find different trends and patterns across your customer base. Get creative. Get weird. The more time you spend refining your targeting, the more likely you will be successful when you start your customer outreach.\n\nOnce you have enough data to fill in the targeting portion of your **Product Market Fit Canvas**, you should consider creating **[Personas](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409500253837-Create-a-Persona)** in the Apollo platform so you have them ready when you start building **[Sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101-Create-a-Sequence)**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Next Steps[](#toc_4)\n\n[![Next Steps](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)\n\nNow that we have identified the companies and individuals that we want to target, we need to carefully craft our messaging in order to maximize our chances of making sales.

It starts with the following key questions:\n\n*   Who should you target?\n*   What problems can you address or solve for your targets?\n*   What solution can you offer to mitigate or solve those problems?\n*   What value does your solution or product offer for your prospects?\n*   What impact or benefits can your solution or product bring for your prospects?\n*   What data points can you offer to support your claims?\n\nYou can track all of these details for each of your outbound campaigns with a **Product Market Fit Canvas**.\n\n| Data Point | A   | B   | C, D, E, etc. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Who: Company |     |     |     |\n| Who: Titles |     |     |     |\n| Problem |     |     |     |\n| Solution |     |     |     |\n| Value Prop |     |     |     |\n| Impact/Benefits |     |     |     |\n| Proof Points |     |     |     |\n\nEach column in your **Product Market Fit Canvas** (A, B, C, D, etc.) represents a different outreach campaign (or, in Apollo parlance, a **sequence**).

Fail again. Fail better.\u201d \u2014Samuel Becket\n\nSales may not have been Samuel Beckett\u2019s vocation, but these 6 simple words certainly resonate with the world of outbound sales. The science of sales analytics boils down to 2 fundamental components: experimentation and testing. What works on one target audience may not work on another. What worked in the past, may not still work in the present. Outbound sales is a fluid process that thrives when you are constantly innovating. If you want to succeed long-term, you need to use the data at your disposal to drive smart decision-making.\n\nSales analytics provide you with the insights that you need to identify key trends and define what is and isn\u2019t working. You can also use them to decide which tests to run and which improvements to make in order to repeatedly smash your monthly and yearly targets on a consistent basis.\n\nThere are 4 main facets of effective sales analytics:\n\n*   **Descriptive Sales Analytics:** Study past sales data such as \u201c% Email Open Rate,\u201d \u201c# of Meetings Set,\u201d and the other sales metrics that you decided to track in the module [**Build an Outbound Sales Process: Metrics**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120718002701-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Metrics), to identify key trends in your current approach.\n*   **Diagnostic Sales Analytics:** Deep dive into your sales metrics to draw conclusions as to why outcomes may have happened. Could a sudden increase or decrease in meetings set be due to the time of day or year that you are reaching out? Could a drop in open rates mean that your subject line needs work, or that your domain is at risk? The more you question and analyze your existing approach, the easier it is to replicate your successes and reduce risks.\n*   **Predictive Sales Analytics:** Learn from your historical data to make informed predictions about the future results that you can hope to achieve. Are you setting realistic goals based on the data from your current and previous outreach campaigns?\n*   **Prescriptive Sales Analytics:** Evaluate all data to draw up a comprehensive plan of action that will help you take the right steps to continue enhancing your outbound sales process. What actions are you going to take to reach the goals you have set and overcome the challenges you may be facing?\n\nThe first ingredient to successful sales analytics is volume. There is a fine line between too much interaction and too little. When starting out you need a big enough sample size to be able to test different approaches. But you must be careful not to ramp up your efforts too quickly. Do so, and you risk ending up in your contacts\u2019 dreaded SPAM box, with little to show for your efforts except for a sprinkle of regret and a tarnished domain!\n\nHere are some key sample metrics to aim for when first starting out:\n\n| Function | Metric | Benchmark |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Targeting | *   \\# Accounts<br>*   \\# Contacts per Account<br>*   \\# Emails per Contact | *   100-1000<br>*   2-5<br>*   2-5 |\n| Activity | *   \\# Emails | *   200-500 per day |\n| Quality of Activity | *   % Email Open Rate<br>*   % Email Reply Rate<br>*   % Email Interested Rate | *   30%-50%<br>*   2%-10%<br>*   0.2%-2% |\n| Results | *   \\# of Meetings Set | *   20 per month |\n\nWhen you launch your first campaigns, begin by sending 200 emails per day, per rep. This should give you a large enough sample size to start testing different approaches every day without putting your domain reputation at high risk.\n\nSPAM!!!\n\nWorried about SPAM raining on your parade? Patience you must have, my young padawan. In the [next module](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120283466509-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Additional-Considerations), we cover this topic in more detail.\n\nAs you test different approaches with each of your target personas, you can use the open, reply, and interest rates from each sequence as a key indicator to gauge whether or not you are targeting the right contacts and accounts, with the right message, at the right time.\n\nCheck the results regularly and ask yourself:\n\n*   **Are you achieving an open rate of at least 30-40%?** If not, is your subject line and approach appropriate and relevant to your target audience? Have you considered testing a different target group or trying alternative tactics to gauge more interest from the subject line?\n*   **Are you achieving at least 0.5% email interest rate?** If not, have you followed the [RRRR messaging approach](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120329878669-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Craft-Killer-Sales-Email-Messaging)? Do your words resonate with your target audience? Did you include a call to action that will encourage a response? Did you align your target with your messaging?\n\nOnce you start to find your footing and your % interest rate rises above 0.5%, you can gradually start to increase the volume of emails you send out per day.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Use Apollo to Analyze Your Outbound Sales Approach[](#toc_2)\n\n[![Apollo Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)\n\n[Apollo analytics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4425592135821-Access-Apollo-Email-Analytics-) provides you with a variety of metrics and insights into the performance of your sales outreach.

These tools, however, do little to help you craft the right messaging to paint your product or service in the right light. This is still largely a manual, hands-on activity that requires careful planning and consideration.\n\nDespite the fact that there are, to date, no technologies to create an effective email message automatically, there are a number of tried and true methods, structures, and best practices for doing this more effectively.\n\nIn his article \u201c[**How To Write Killer Sales Emails\u2026 At Scale**](https://winningbydesign.com/how-to-write-killer-sales-emails-at-scale/),\u201d Jacco van der Kooij of [Winning by Design](https://winningbydesign.com/) outlines the [**Research, Reference, Reward, and Request**](https://winningbydesign.com/how-to-write-killer-sales-emails-at-scale/) method\u2014a means of creating winning email messages. We can apply this methodology to our outbound sales process and leverage the tools in the Apollo platform to make sure that we deliver personalized and relevant email messages at scale.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### The RRRR Method[](#toc_2)\n\nAs we mentioned above, the RRRR method focuses on 4 primary functions:\n\n*   Research\n*   Reference\n*   Reward\n*   Request\n\nEach of these component pieces will help you to craft a personalized, relevant email message for your customer segments. In his article, van der Kooij is quick to point out that you cannot \u201csell over email.\u201d\n\n**This is absolutely vital to remember.**\n\nEmail is just one facet of a multi-touch outreach campaign; however, it is something that you need to get right if you want to get your foot in the door. Let\u2019s take a look at the first stage of customer outreach\u2014**Research**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### Do Your Research![](#toc_3)\n\nMost businesses receive multiple emails each day from contacts who attempt to gain their business. It is no longer a simple matter of personalizing your outreach with a recipient\u2019s name or company name. Outreach emails also need to be relevant. That means that you need to do your due diligence in trying to find as much information about each contact before you reach out to them.\n\nLinkedIn and the Apollo database both provide a lot of great information about contacts, but it may be worthwhile for you to dig a little deeper. Search the web for any recent publications that the contact may have. Find out what their alma matter is and what role they currently have. This information helps you to craft a strong opening line and shows your recipient that you have done some research so that your outreach doesn\u2019t feel entirely cold.\n\nOnce you have completed your research, don\u2019t forget to fill in your **Product Market Fit** **Canvas**. Conducting this analysis will provide you with the context and purpose you need to write poignant messages that resonate with your target personas.\n\n|     | A   | B   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Who: Company | SMB Startups | YC Startups in Current batch |\n| Who: Titles | Founders | Founders |\n| Problem | *   Need more opportunties<br>*   Hard to build outbound system from scratch | *   Generates as much revenue as possible pre-demo, but hard to set up |\n| Solution | *   All in One<br>*   200M Contact Database<br>*   Emailing Engine | *   All in One sales platform for generating opportunities with 200M contacts<br>*   Emailing Engine |\n| Value Prop | *   Build a best-practice outbound engine in minutes | *   Build a best-practice outbound engine in minutes |\n| Impact/Benefits | *   Generate hundreds of qualifeid sales meetings | *   Generate hundreds of qualified sales meetings and hit their Demo Day goals |\n| Proof Points | 5,000 SMB startups like XYZ do ABC | Hundreds of other YC startups like XYZ do ABC |\n\nKnow Your Prospects\n\nRemember, the more specific and targeted your research is, the better chance you have of establishing a rapport with your prospects.\n\nWhen you do this at scale, you\u2019ll need a place to store all of this information as it relates to specific contacts. This will make it easier for you to reference in your emails. Apollo allows you to store contact-specific research directly in a [**custom field**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412498825869-Create-Custom-Contact-Fields) that\u2019s available on each **contact\u2019s** profile.\n\n[![Profile](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i2.png)\n\nYou can create custom fields to store research for **Accounts** in Apollo:\n\n[![Accounts](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i3.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### Determine Appropriate References[](#toc_4)\n\nReferences help to demonstrate to your email recipient that you understand what their pain points are and that you\u2019ve worked with other customers who had the same set of problems or needs. You may be able to draw these conclusions by analyzing the details your research provides. For example, from the information available about a company\u2019s technology stack or a contact\u2019s vertical or role at an organization.\n\nIn some ways, the references you make are related to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and the problems that they need to solve. These companies are the ones who have benefited most from your product. If you need a refresher about what an ICP is and how to assemble it, check out this infographic:\n\n[![ICP](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i4.jpg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i4.jpg)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### Describe The Reward[](#toc_5)\n\nThis is your opportunity to further entice your email recipient and build credibility with them. Is there a resource that you can share with them from your company\u2019s blog that gets to the heart of their pain points? Even better, are there any thought leadership materials that you created yourself that you can link to? Anything you can provide that indicates you are a worthwhile connection and that your organization is a trusted leader can help you to initiate that all-important first meeting.\n\nForget the Attachments\n\nRemember to link to any resources you provide\u2014attachments in first-contact emails can trigger SPAM blocking. For more information about avoid SPAM filters, check out the \u201c[**Avoid SPAM Filters**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-SPAM-Filters)\u201d article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n#### Formulate Your Request[](#toc_6)\n\nA well-formed call-to-action is a great way to close out your email. Without this, a recipient has no idea what you want from them or why you\u2019ve contacted them in the first place. Even if you\u2019ve crafted an email that is well-researched with amazing references and a great reward, the conversation stops here without a **Request**. Keep in mind what we mentioned earlier\u2014you aren\u2019t going to close a sale through email. Your request should be focused on setting up a call or meeting with the recipient.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Put It All Together[](#toc_7)\n\nRemember, the goal of using the **RRRR Method** in outreach campaigns is to create a formula for crafting relevant and personalized email messages at scale. The people you are reaching out to are just as busy as you are\u2014they don\u2019t have time and won\u2019t read something that doesn\u2019t immediately grab their attention or apply to them.\n\nSubject lines are vitally important to grab a potential customer\u2019s attention right away. In fact, 35% of email recipients open an email based on the [subject line alone](https://www.convinceandconvert.com/convince-convert/15-email-statistics-that-are-shaping-the-future/) and 69% of email recipients [report email as spam based solely on the subject line](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/email-subject-lines-statistics-and-trends/). In the example below, we\u2019ve used 3 of the 4 components to create our subject line, **Research**, **Reference**, and **Request**.\n\n[![RRR](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i5.png)\n\nThis subject matter makes a clear reference to the content of the email\u2014\u201cSalesforce/Adoption issues.\u201d It also includes a strong call-to-action for the recipient\u2014\u201dTalk on Friday?\u201d If the person who receives this email is a Salesforce user who has had difficulty adopting the platform at their organization, this should at least pique their interest enough to get them to open the email.\n\nKeep it Tight. Keep it Focused.\n\nThis tried and tested tactic only works if you stay true to the company segments you have built out in your **Product Market Fit Canvas**. The **Reference** in your subject line absolutely should match the painpoints for the specific contacts who open it. In the case of our example above, we may have a killer subject line, but if we send a message with the same subject line to non-Salesforce users, we\u2019re fighting a losing battle.\n\nNext, let\u2019s take a look at how to craft the body of the message. The image below shows a breakdown of how each component should inform the contents of your email.\n\n[![RRR Components](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i6.png)\n\nHere\u2019s how we applied each of those recommendations to the body copy of our own email message:\n\n[![RRR Email](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i7.png)\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each individual component. We address the recipient by name; Jennifer. You can easily accomplish this at scale in Apollo with **[Basic Snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813-Use-Basic-Snippets)**. Then, we transition to the **Research** portion of the body copy.\n\nYour Linkedin profile shows that you led the Salesforce Implementation at Acme.\n\nHere, we\u2019ve established that we know who we are talking to and what function or responsibilities they hold at their company.\n\nNext, we move on to the **Reference** portion of the body copy:\n\nYour peer at \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ experienced the exact same challenge. I wanted to share a link that shows how he \nsolved the Salesforce Integration that resulted in increased adoption and made their reps \nmore productive.\n\nIn this part of the body copy, we have likened the pain points experienced by the recipient to a company that they might be familiar with. Additionally, we\u2019ve provided some details around how they addressed these pain points and turned them into a positive. This helps to create rapport with our recipients and demonstrates that they aren\u2019t the only person or business.\n\nFinally, we move on to the **Request** portion of the body copy:\n\nJennifer, is this relevant for you?\n\nHere, our call-to-action comes in the form of a question. We\u2019ve asked something specifically of our recipient in the hope that she will respond. In this instance, an affirmative answer is just as valuable as a negative one. This is because it allows us to continue the conversation, either specifically with Jennifer or we can follow up again to ask if there is someone else that we should talk to instead. If Jennifer does respond after a few follow-up emails, we may want to shift our focus to someone else in the organization if this account is a strong match for our **Product Market Fit Canvas**.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Use Apollo To Create An Outreach Campaign and Follow Up With Your Prospects[](#toc_8)\n\n[![Apollo Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i2.png)\n\nRemember, an outreach campaign requires multiple touches and interactions. In an average outreach campaign, we would recommend you follow up with someone between at least 2 and 5 times. The email that we dissected in the section above is an example of an introductory email, but you may need to send follow-up emails, schedule calls, and participate in other tasks before you can close a deal.\n\nApollo **Sequences** allow you to create outreach campaigns at scale. In the [Build an Outbound Sales Process: Target Real Buyers](https://www.notion.so/Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Target-Real-Buyers-4afe69595a264905bd37d922fddd97f0) article, we found real people to reach out to and saved them to a list. We can use that list along with the email messaging we worked on in this article to [create an Apollo **sequence**.](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101-Create-a-Sequence)\n\n[![Sequence](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/build_an_outbound_sales_process_craft_killer_sales_email_messaging/i8.png)\n\nA typical outreach campaign may take many different forms. Below, we have outlined 3 potential options for you to consider when you structure your campaign/**sequence**. Each of these consists of 2-4 email steps.\n\n### Option A[](#toc_9)\n\nThis option starts with a well-crafted introductory email. It also includes 3 additional emails with a \u201cJust following up\u201d email message.\n\nThese types of email campaigns are relatively low touch and may not result in as much success.\n\n### Option B[](#toc_10)\n\nThis option is a bit more time-consuming as it requires you to follow up with more contact-specific information. You\u2019ll start your outreach with a well-crafted introductory email, but each subsequent follow-up should utilize new talking points, different problems, solutions, value propositions, impacts, and proof points. The table below shows an example of what this might look like:\n\n|     | General (A.1.1) | Email 2 (A.1.2) | Email 3 (A.1.3) | Email 4 (A.1.4) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Who: Company | YC Startups in Current Batch | YC Startups in Current Batch | YC Startups in Current Batch | YC Startups in Current Batch |\n| Who: Titles | Founders | Founders | Founders | Founders |\n| Problem | Generate as much revenue as possible before Demo day | HArd to find leads at scale for outbounding | HArd to set up outbound systems from scratch | Access to good databases are expensive, sometimes more than $20,000 per year |\n| Solution | All in one outbound sales platform for generating opportunities with 200 million contacts and an email engine | 200 million contact database with emails | All-in-one system cthat combines data with email automation best practices | Turnkey soltuion with unlimited leads for a small flat rate fee |\n| Value Prop | Build best-practice outbound engine in minutes | Set more meetings by 5x the number of people you can reach out to | Save time and get better results | Save money |\n\n### Option C[](#toc_11)\n\nThis technique is a hybrid approach of Options A and B and is the most extensive of all 3 options. Apollo generally recommends using Option C. An example might look like this:\n\n1.  Value Prop 1 (new thread)\n2.  \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\n3.  Value Prop 2 (new thread)\n4.  \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\n5.  Value Prop 3 (new thread)\n6.  \"Just following up\" (reply to the thread)\n\nIn this instance, the initial email follows a similar structure to Option A and B and lays out your initial value proposition. The second email in the campaign is a reply to the initial email and follows the \u201cJust following up\u201d email structure. The third email starts a brand new thread and lays out a new set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Email 4 is a follow-up to the third email thread. Email 5 starts a brand new thread and provides yet another set of problems, solutions, and value propositions. Finally, email 6 concludes with a \u201cJust following up\u201d response to email 5. If at this point, the contact still has not engaged with you, they likely aren\u2019t going to. Our own testing at Apollo has shown that these follow-up emails can be vital to your success. They may even lead you to book 4 times the amount of meetings you might otherwise book.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Practical Exercise[](#toc_12)\n\n[![Practical Exercise](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i3.png)\n\nFinish filling out your **Product Market Fit Canvas** with the relevant details for **Problem**, **Solution**, **Value Prop**, **Impact/Benefit**, and **Proof Points**. You can use a combination of information from your ICP research as well as the information in your company\u2019s business plan to fill it out.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nIf your team uses a video communications tool for sales or recruitment calls, you can integrate your Apollo instance with your Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams account. Use Apollo conversations to access your video call recordings and leverage important meeting insights from within Apollo.\n\nThere are several benefits of integrating your communications tool with Apollo, including:\n\n*   More effectively managing and analyzing your team\u2019s video call recordings.\n*   Playing your call recordings, accessing high-accuracy transcripts and call clips, leveraging AI-written call summaries, and uncovering account and attendee data from each call.\n*   Coaching and scaling successful conversations to increase call conversions.\n\nThe following sections detail how to set up conversations and configure the related settings.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 0: Link Your Mailbox to Use Conversations[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo only pulls in recordings from the meetings you schedule via the mailboxes you've connected to Apollo. If you haven't already, [connect your mailboxes](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093) to gain full conversations functionality.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Add Integrations[](#toc_3)\n\nApollo supports 3 communication platforms for conversations:\n\n*   Zoom\n*   Google Meet\n*   Microsoft Teams\n\nTo access call recordings and utilize conversations functionality, you need to integrate Apollo with at least 1 of these platforms. If you use multiple communication platforms, you can add multiple integrations.\n\nGot Admin Superpowers?\n\nOnly Zoom and Apollo admins can integrate a Zoom Pro, Business, Business Plus, or Enterprise account with Apollo. If you are not an admin for either account, please contact a team member with the necessary permissions to set up the integration. For more information on permission profiles in Apollo, refer to [Create and Assign Permission Profiles](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409154208269).

If you want to integrate with other communications platform, follow the steps in the **Multiple Video Conferencing Platforms** tab. Otherwise, proceed to set your team's permissions.\n\nLiving Life in the Present\n\nApollo pulls all new calls that your team records after you connect Apollo with your communications platform. Apollo does not display the previous conversations you recorded before you set up the integration.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Set Your Team's Permissions[](#toc_4)\n\nApollo records meetings for users that have view and record permissions.\n\nTo add or remove permissions, click or unclick the checkbox next to the teams you want to include or exclude.

Launch Apollo and click **Settings** [**Conversations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/conversations).\n2.  Choose whether to record all conversations or only conversations that include a participant from outside your organization. [![Record all conversations or only conversations with external participants.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i2.png)\n3.  To avoid recording calls that involve certain organizations, enter their domain names and press enter. For example, if you add `acmecorp.com` to your exclusion list, Apollo will not record a conversation that involves a participant with a `acmecorp.com` email address. [![Exclude domains from being recorded.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i3.png)\n4.  Enter the minimum number of minutes you want your calls to last for Apollo to process the meeting in conversations. Apollo does not save or pull a meeting into conversations if it lasts less than the call duration you set here. [![Set a minimum recording duration.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i4.png)\n5.  If you connected a Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom (not Zoom Pro+) account, Apollo's [recording bot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/18637632165645) needs to join your meeting to enable recording.\n    \n    If you want to change the recording bot's default name, enter a new name. Be mindful that all meeting participants will see the bot name. [![Change recording bot name.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i5.png)\n    \n6.  Click **Save** to update the settings.\n\nLet's Get Creative!\n\nWant the flexibility to record some internal calls, but not all? Consider creating a waiting room in your communications platform. The host can decide whether to admit the bot and record a call or not!\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Add Recording Consent Message[](#toc_7)\n\nIn many countries and US states, you need permission from all participants before you can record calls. To inform participants that a call will be recorded, Apollo enables you to send email notifications prior to the call, and make an audio announcement during the call.\n\nTo add recording consent messages:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** [**Conversations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/conversations).\n2.  Toggle the **Recording announcement** slider on to make an audio consent announcement at the beginning of a call. Then, choose when the audio announcement will happen and message language. [![Change recording bot name.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i10.png)\n3.  Toggle the **Email notifications** slider on to send a email to participants prior to the call. Choose the time when the email will be sent to internal and external participants. Then, you can either use the default notification message by not editing it, or enter your own custom message. [![Change recording bot name.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i12.png)\n4.  Click **Save** to add your recording consent messages.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Record Conversations[](#toc_8)\n\nDepending on the video conferencing platform, Apollo records meetings in 1 of 2 ways:\n\n*   **Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom (not Zoom Pro+)**: Apollo's recording bot joins the meeting. Depending on your video conference platform settings, the bot can either auto-join your calls or you can choose to allow the bot into the meeting each time. Either way, you need to make sure that the recording bot is in your meeting.\n*   **Zoom Pro+**: The platform records the meeting, and then Apollo imports that cloud recording. No recording bot joins your meetings.\n\nTo ensure a future call is set to record, launch Apollo and click [**Conversations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/conversations). Then, access the **My upcoming meetings** tab and confirm the recording status of your upcoming calls.\n\nIf you are using a platform other than Zoom Pro+, Apollo needs at least 30 minutes to analyze your inbox and find the meetings that need the recording bot. If you schedule a last-minute meeting that is less than 30 minutes in the future, Apollo might not have enough time to analyze your inbox, so the recording bot will not know to join the meeting.\n\nTo manually send the recording bot to your meeting, click **Record now** and add the meeting URL. The Apollo recording bot then joins your call when the meeting starts.\n\n[![Record an ad-hoc conversation.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i13.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_conversations/i13.png)\n\nCheck the Settings\n\nYou can use the recording bot to manually record your calls even if you haven't linked your mailbox or connected your conferencing platform.\n\nIf you don't have access to the **Record now** button, ask your Apollo admin to update your conversations settings. Admins can update the [recorded user settings](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/conversations/users) to determine which team members can record calls with the recording bot.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Access Your Recorded Conversations[](#toc_9)\n\nTo access your team's recorded conversations, including key insights and transcripts, launch Apollo and click [**Conversations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/conversations).\n\nFor more information about how to take advantage of conversations, please refer to the [Access Your Conversations in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9632855570701). If your run into issues with your recordings, check out the guidance in [Troubleshoot Conversations](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/18637632165645).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Stop Recording Conversations in Apollo[](#toc_10)\n\nIf you are an admin, you can disconnect your communications platform from Apollo and stop recording video calls at any time.\n\nYou can also reconnect at any time. However, Apollo does not pull in any historical data. When you reconnect, Apollo does not display any calls that your team recorded when the integration was disconnected.\n\nTo disconnect an integration and stop recording conversations in Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** [**Integrations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations).\n2.  In the **Connected integration**, click **Disconnect** for the integration you want to remove.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nConversations provide easy access to your team's video call recordings within Apollo. Beyond providing the ability to watch recordings of your meetings, conversations enables you to access AI-generated call summaries, comment on recordings, and submit scorecards to assess and train sales teams.\n\nZoom Your Way Through These Steps First\n\nBefore you can access conversations in Apollo, you need to follow the instructions in [Set Up Apollo Conversations](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8274034041997).\n\nWhen you finish the set-up process, Apollo starts to pull all new calls that your team records after you connect Apollo with your communications platform. Apollo does not display the previous conversations you recorded before you integrated the 2 platforms. When you finish hosting a meeting, Apollo needs a moment to process and upload a recording. You'll see new recordings in Apollo as soon as the magic finishes!\n\nThe following sections detail how to search and view call recordings, access a variety of call insights, share recordings, and read call transcripts.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## View and Sort Your Conversations[](#toc_1)\n\nLaunch Apollo and click [**Conversations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/conversations/recordings). From this page, you can view all the calls you and your team have recorded since connecting your account with Apollo.\n\nClick the **Sort by** drop-down to sort your team's call recordings in order of the recorded date or duration.

You can also configure alerts to remind you when you need to take manual actions.\n\nThe following sections detail the key benefits of plays by role and provide example use cases from the play templates library.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand Benefits of Plays for Your Role[](#toc_1)\n\nDifferent roles experience distinct advantages when leveraging plays in Apollo, including:\n\n| Role | Benefits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sales Development Reps (SDRs) and Account Executives (AEs) | *   Automate your prospecting activities to book more meetings and generate more revenue.<br>*   Reduce arduous manual tasks and spend more time in meetings with your ideal prospects. |\n| Sales Leaders | *   Improve your team's efficiency and establish best practices that help you scale the end-to-end workflows that drive the highest impact.<br>*   Automate successful go-to-market strategies that enable your reps to dedicate more time to the activities that generate the most revenue.<br>*   Increase and improve pipeline by creating automated, repeatable, and scalable processes that work. |\n| Founders and CEOs | *   Improve team efficiency and automate tedious tasks that help your team focus on the most impactful activities that lead to consistent growth.<br>*   Automate your entire lead generation and talent recruitment process in one platform to scale your business effectively as your team closes more and more deals.<br>*   Empower your team to generate more pipeline and automate the entire go-to-market workflow; from lead generation to prospecting to booked meetings and beyond. |\n| Demand Gen | *   Automate lead generation and increase overall [TAM](https://www.apollo.io/blog/tam-sam-som-framework/) coverage with Apollo's B2B data and automation.<br>*   Improve efficiency across teams and automate manual tasks and CRM syncs to ensure no marketing leads fall through the cracks when you pass them over to sales. |\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create Plays[](#toc_2)\n\nWhen you [create a play](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413804036109), use templates from Apollo to quickly generate new pipeline, secure more meetings, retain existing business, and automate several other parts of the sales workflow.\n\nAlternatively, build plays from scratch that run based on a variety of triggers and automated actions.\n\n[![Build plays using templates.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i2.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Run Account-based Sales Motions[](#toc_3)\n\nUse plays to more effectively target high-priority accounts. A successful account-based sales motion relies on your team consistently finding the right contacts at your high-priority accounts, and that often means manual prospecting and messaging.\n\nTo avoid those tedious manual tasks, follow Apollo's [example account-based play](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/25983156332557) to automatically surface the right contacts and add them to sequences.\n\n[![Queue contacts from your priority accounts.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i6.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Receive Slack Notifications for Plays[](#toc_4)\n\n[Set up the Apollo-Slack integration](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/22464817775117) to receive plays-related alerts in Slack. Use Slack notifications to inform yourself or other members of your team that a play ran in Apollo, or that they need to take a manual action in Apollo such as calling a contact or adding an account to a list.\n\nAlso, add a priority status to notifications so that team members can easily determine how quickly they need to take action in Apollo.\n\n[![Receive plays notifications in Slack.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i4.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Prepare for Plays Success[](#toc_5)\n\nIf you've just started exploring plays, [take steps to better leverage plays](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/14062758984717) when automating your sales workflow.\n\nFor example, if you plan on using Apollo's integrations with [Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/7525314188173) and [HubSpot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416619021837), you might want to map custom fields between Apollo and the CRM so you can use those fields in your plays. Or, if you want to quickly move to target accounts and contacts surfaced via plays, create sequences that automate outreach to those prospects.\n\n[![Map fields between Apollo and your CRM.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_overview/i5.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Start Automating Your Sales Workflows[](#toc_6)\n\nReady to build plays and automate your workflows?

This often means undertaking the time-consuming process of manually identifying and targeting prospects with the right messaging.\n\nApollo enables your team to automate your ABSM with plays. Set up plays that focus on surfacing contacts for your highest priority accounts. Then, either automatically move those contacts into your sequences, or add tasks to account queues so account owners can manually decide how to engage them with them.\n\nThe following sections describe how to create a play in Apollo for your ABSM strategy and manage contacts that are added to account queues.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Example: Create a Play to Target Priority Accounts[](#toc_1)\n\nThe following walkthrough explores how your team can set up a play to surface contacts at a high-priority account, but plays in Apollo offer a variety of automations beyond this specific use case.

You want to create a play to reach out to your customers 3 months before their contract is due for renewal.\n\nYour goal is to increase retention and strengthen customer relationships. So, you set up a play to encourage your CSMs to be proactive, maintain a personalized approach, and automate manual tasks to increase their overall efficiency.\n\nYou want to ensure each contact you enroll in the play is contacted by their dedicated Customer Success Manager.\n\nLet's run through the steps you take in Apollo to set up a killer play that helps your team get ahead of renewals.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Create Users in Apollo[](#toc_4)\n\nBefore you begin, you need to ensure that all the CSMs you want to enroll in your play exist in Apollo and have a mailbox from which to send emails.\n\n### Integrate Your CRM with Apollo[](#toc_5)\n\nIf you haven't already, you also integrate your CRM with the Apollo platform.\n\nSalesforce or HubSpot\n\nPlease note, Apollo's CRM integrations come in 2 delicious flavors: Salesforce and HubSpot. Use the links below for the CRM that you want to integrate and configure with Apollo.\n\n#### Salesforce[](#toc_6)\n\n**Integration**\n\n*   [Connect Apollo to Your Salesforce Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725-Connect-Apollo-to-Your-Salesforce-Account)\n*   [Understand Opportunity Stages and Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415294726029-Understand-Opportunity-Stages-and-Salesforce-)\n\n**Credentials**\n\n*   [Salesforce Credentials Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415287562893-Salesforce-Credentials-Overview)\n*   [Connect \"Team Sync\" Authentication Credentials to Your Salesforce Integration](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415294638733-Connect-Team-Sync-Authentication-Credentials-To-Your-Salesforce-Integration)\n\n#### HubSpot[](#toc_7)\n\n**Integration**\n\n*   [Connect Apollo to Your HubSpot Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416619021837)\n\nOnce you've connected your CRM to Apollo, your customer data stays accurate and in sync. Now, you're ready to create a sequence for your renewal play.\n\n### Create a Sequence[](#toc_8)\n\nYou work with your CSMs to build a personalized multi-channel sequence to engage with your contacts in the run-up to their contract end date.\n\n[![Upcoming renewals sequence example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i1.png)\n\n### Create a List[](#toc_9)\n\nThen, you create a company renewal list specifically for this play so that when a contact meets the play criteria, you can automatically add them to this list.\n\n[![Example renewal list](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i2.png)\n\n### Create Custom Fields in Your CRM[](#toc_10)\n\nNext, you create 2 custom fields in your CRM:\n\n*   1 for your CSMs so that Apollo enrolls the right CSM for each contact.\n*   1 for the renewal date so that Apollo only enrolls the contacts who are due for renewal\n\n**Salesforce**\n\n[![New custom field screen in Salesforce](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i4.png)\n\nSalesforce Users\n\nNeed a helping hand creating a custom field in Salesforce?

This allows you to sync custom data back and forth between Apollo and your CRM to run your play with ease.\n\n**Apollo**\n\nYou can create 3 types of custom fields in Apollo: custom contact, account, or user fields. For this specific use case, you create a custom contact field for your CSMs. You also create one for the contract renewal date.\n\n[![Create a custom contact modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i7.png)\n\n**Salesforce**\n\nIf you are a Salesforce user, you map the custom contact and/or lead fields in Salesforce with the equivalent custom contact fields when you [create or edit them in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412498825869-Create-Custom-Contact-Fields#toc_3).\n\n[![Create custom contact modal with Salesforce mapping field](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i3.png)\n\nApollo supports linking your custom contact fields to a Salesforce Contact Field or Salesforce Lead Field\u2014depending on what makes the most sense for your integration. You can also sync to both object types at the same time. If you do so, the Apollo custom contact field automatically becomes \"Read Only.\" You can disable the \"Read Only\" setting by removing one of the mapped objects.\n\n**HubSpot**\n\nIf you are a HubSpot user, you map the custom contact fields you created in HubSpot with the equivalent custom contact fields when you [create or edit them in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412498825869-Create-Custom-Contact-Fields#toc_3).\n\n[![Create custom contact modal with HubSpot mapping field](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/plays_use_case/i6.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Play Time![](#toc_12)\n\nThe World's Your Oyster\n\nIn this article, we customize an existing template but don't let that stop you from getting creative.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nBi-Directional Sync Availability\n\nPlease note, bi-directional syncing is only available on certain plans. See the [Apollo Pricing Guide](https://www.apollo.io/pricing/) for more information.\n\nBi-directional syncing allows two datasets in two different systems to act as one. This kind of synchronization allows you to keep consistent data across multiple platforms. It also helps you prevent stale data and resolves conflicts between Apollo and your CRM.\n\nApollo uses bi-directional syncing to streamline your experience. Refer to the following sections to discover how Apollo protects and integrates your existing contact data from your CRM with the Apollo contact database.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### How Does Apollo Use Bi-Directional Syncing?[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo allows you to sync contact data between your saved contacts and HubSpot or Salesforce.\n\nUse bi-directional syncing to keep your contact data consistent between your CRM and your saved contacts in the ever-evolving Apollo database.\n\nSince the sync is bi-directional, you can both sync your CRM to your saved contacts in Apollo and sync your saved contacts in Apollo to your CRM. Do this regularly to keep your contact data up-to-date on both platforms.\n\nWhen you [sync your CRM](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725) with Apollo, Apollo cross-references your data with your saved contacts in the Apollo database and enriches any missing or inaccurate data.\n\nCRM Integration\n\nPlease note, you can only connect 1 CRM to Apollo at a time. For example, if you connect a Salesforce account to Apollo, you can't also connect a HubSpot account.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### How Does Apollo Protect Its Database?[](#toc_3)\n\nWith bi-directional syncing, it is possible to import or export corrupt data. To protect your data and the Apollo database from data pollution, you work within your own instance of Apollo.\n\nThis protects your data and shields the Apollo database from accidental corruption. Each user has the base instance of Apollo and can sync with [HubSpot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416619021837-Connect-Apollo-to-Your-HubSpot-Account) or [Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725-Connect-Apollo-to-Your-Salesforce-Account).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412668783117-Bi-Directional-Sync-Overview"}

The right bar (Total Data Points) reflects the total number of enriched data points over the total number of possible data points.\n\n[![Enrichment Result](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i4.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Matched Fields[](#toc_7)\n\nThe **Matched Fields** section provides you with an overview of the fields that you mapped during the upload process. The first bar provides you with the number of fields that you mapped during this process. The second bar provides you with the total number of mapped CSV fields that Apollo was able to match values from. The third bar provides you with the total number of mapped CSV fields that Apollo could not match values from.\n\n[![Matched Fields](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i9.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i9.png)\n\nWhy do I have \"Unmatched Fields?\"\n\nTypically, \"Unmatched Fields\" result from fields mapped incorrectly during the upload process. For example, if you mapped your CSV's \"Title\" column to Apollo's \"First Name\" field, Apollo would not be able to match any values for it.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Emails Enriched[](#toc_8)\n\nThe **Emails Enriched** section provides you with the total number of records (rows) in your CSV. It is displayed as a pie graph and is segmented by rows enriched with \"Verified\" email addresses, rows enriched with \"Not Verified\" email addresses, and rows where an email address was \"Not Found.\"\n\n[![Emails Enriched](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/csv_enrichment_reports_overview/i10.png)\n\n*   **Verified**: The total number of verified emails that Apollo matched to the records in the CSV\n*   **Not Verified**: The total number of unverified emails that Apollo matched to the records in the CSV\n*   **Not found**: The total number of records for which Apollo could not find an email\n\nHover your mouse over an individual segment to see the number of records for that segment.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Phone Numbers Enriched[](#toc_9)\n\nThe **Phone Numbers Enriched** section provides you with two fields.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nDeals helps you to track possible deals with prospective customers. In addition to people and company records, deals enables you to manage your entire sales pipeline directly within Apollo.\n\nThis allows you to engage prospects in more meaningful ways, keep track of everything in one place, and move deals faster. You can associate deals with both companies and people, and you can also sync them to or from Salesforce.\n\nThe following sections detail the features that are available on the deals page, as well as information about how specific roles can benefit from using them.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Learn How Deals Impacts Your Role (SDRs and AEs)[](#toc_1)\n\nWhile deals is a useful tool for most Apollo users, the following roles often benefit the most from deals.\n\n**SDRs**\n\nSales Development Reps (SDRs) gain visibility on current or historical deals to help guide contextual conversations at both the individual and account levels. SDRs can also use the deals screen to help coach their teams and unlock additional sales dollars.\n\n**Account Executives**\n\nAccount Executives gain a seamless workflow for contacts, accounts, and deals. This eliminates the need to navigate to multiple applications (Apollo, Salesforce, etc.) to access and update critical data as the sales cycle progresses. This gives you a full view of your sales funnel, from top to bottom, in one location.\n\nAdditionally, Account Executives can send and track messages and add contextual information to deals to ensure things are recorded for posterity.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Enable Deals for Non-Admins[](#toc_2)\n\nBy default, users with non-admin roles in your Apollo account cannot access or edit deals. If you are an Apollo admin that wants to provide deals functionality to non-admins:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**Permission Profiles**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/permissions-profiles).\n2.  Click a user profile to access the permissions for it.

Find the **Deals** permissions. Click the **Can access & view Deals data** checkbox to allow non-admins to access deals. Click the **Can add or edit deal roles** checkbox to also provide non-admins the ability to add or change a contact's role in a deal.

To access deals, launch Apollo and click [**Deals**](https://app.apollo.io/#/opportunities).\n\nThe following sections detail how to navigate and use the deals page.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Use Table View[](#toc_5)\n\nClick **Table view** to see your deals in a table format. By default, deals are placed in order based on when they were created. Use the arrows at the top of each column to sort by other values.\n\n[![Use table view.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i23.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i23.png)\n\nTo customize the columns in the table view, click **Table Column Settings**.\n\n[![Change the table columns.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i24.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i24.png)\n\n### Use Board (Kanban) View[](#toc_6)\n\nClick **Board view** to see your deals in a Kanban board format. This option enables you to more easily view all of your deals organized by the current stage.\n\n[![Deals](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i3.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Use Filters to Find Deals[](#toc_7)\n\nUse the search bar to find specific deals.\n\n[![Search deals.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i21.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i21.png)\n\nUse filters to find deals based on details such as stage or deal owner.\n\n[![Filter deals.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i22.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i22.png)\n\nWhen using search filters on the deals page, [save your searches](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409803718669) to use them again as you would in other areas of Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Access More Deal Information[](#toc_8)\n\nThe table on the deals page shows high-level details about all of your deals.\n\nTo access more information about each deal, either click the empty space in a row for any deal to open the details sidebar, or click the deal title to access the same information on a separate page. The deal details are the same in both areas. Depending on the contact information available, you can call or email the contact for the account.\n\n[![Columns to Show](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i18.png)\n\nFrom the **Overview** tab, you can view and add contacts, tasks, and [conversations](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9632855570701#toc_12) related to the deal.\n\n[![View items related to the deal.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i33.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i33.png)\n\nFrom the **Activity** section of the Overview tab, you can view a timeline of activities related to the deal, including any emails, notes, and conversations that have been added. You can also add a note or [associate a conversation to the deal](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9632855570701#toc_12) from this section.\n\n[![View activities related to the deal.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i32.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i32.png)\n\nFrom the **All fields** tab, you can review every Apollo field related to the deal and manage those fields.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Export Deals[](#toc_9)\n\nTo export deals data to a CSV file:\n\n1.  Click the checkbox next to one or more deals.\n2.  Click **...** > **Export**.

[![Push deals to Salesforce.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i25.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_deals/i25.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Learn About the Salesforce Integration and Deals[](#toc_10)\n\nIf you've integrated Salesforce with your Apollo account, Apollo uses the Opportunity stages you have configured on the Salesforce side for your deals stages, and automatically disables the creation of new deal stages. Refer to [Configure Your Salesforce Pull Settings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414496822797) for help with mapping fields to deals.\n\nApollo does this because it is not possible to create or update Opportunity stages through the Salesforce API. The Salesforce Opportunity page is configured as read-only, which means Apollo can only pull this data from Salesforce.\n\nAlso, removing a contact from a deal in Apollo does not remove them from your Opportunity in Salesforce. Unlike Apollo, Salesforce does not allow the same contact to have multiple contact roles listed. Instead, any contacts with multiple roles will appear multiple times (once for each role) in the **Contact Roles** section of a Salesforce Opportunity.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create Deals[](#toc_11)\n\nReady to create a new deal in Apollo?

It then explains how to update those values using the appropriate endpoint. To review reference information for the API, refer to [Apollo's developer documentation](https://apolloio.github.io/apollo-api-docs/#introduction).\n\nTo update a custom field value for an Apollo contact:\n\n1.  Call the following endpoint to retrieve a list of all custom fields in Apollo.

In the response, find the ID of each field for a contact that you want to update. To update picklist values, collect the IDs for each of the values.\n    \n    For this example, Apollo will update a custom field called `Custom Field Test`, as shown in the following sample response. The ID for the field is `5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702a`, and the ID for the `Option 1` picklist value is `5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702d`.\n    \n\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702a\",\n    \"modality\": \"contact\",\n    \"name\": \"Custom Field Test\",\n    \"type\": \"picklist\",\n    \"picklist_options\": [],\n    \"mapped_crm_field\": null,\n    \"additional_mapped_crm_field\": null,\n    \"is_readonly_mapped_crm_field\": null,\n    \"picklist_options_last_synced_at\": \"2020-12-03T01:04:44.000+00:00\",\n    \"picklist_value_set_id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702b\",\n    \"mirrored\": false,\n    \"system_name\": null,\n    \"text_field_max_length\": null,\n    \"picklist_values\": [\n        {\n            \"_id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702d\",\n            \"mapped_crm_values\": {\n                \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702a\": null\n            },\n            \"name\": \"Option 1\",\n            \"id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702d\",\n            \"key\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702d\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"_id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702e\",\n            \"mapped_crm_values\": {\n                \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702a\": null\n            },\n            \"name\": \"Option 2\",\n            \"id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702e\",\n            \"key\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702e\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"_id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702f\",\n            \"mapped_crm_values\": {\n                \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702a\": null\n            },\n            \"name\": \"Option 3\",\n            \"id\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702f\",\n            \"key\": \"5fc8399eb6ae07008cb7702f\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n3.

If you try to map the same Apollo stage to multiple HubSpot fields or the same HubSpot status to multiple Apollo fields, stage mapping between HubSpot and Apollo may not function accurately.\n\nIf you ever need to change the name of a HubSpot status after you\u2019ve mapped it in Apollo, or if you add a new status entirely, it\u2019s important to make sure you reflect those changes in Apollo and update your mappings. This way, Apollo can continue to map 1:1 with all of your HubSpot statuses. Similarly, any time you delete a status in HubSpot, you must delete the Apollo stage to which you mapped it and move the contact/accounts associated with that stage to an active one. You must also map this stage to a status in HubSpot.\n\nHave additional HubSpot-related questions?

{"text": "## Watch the Video[](#toc_7)\n\n## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nIntegrating Salesforce with Apollo enables you to access and keep your data synchronized within both platforms.\n\nBefore you integrate Salesforce with Apollo though, there are several important details to remember that can help you streamline the setup process and reduce the risk of unnecessary errors when integrating Salesforce.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand Salesforce Pull Settings[](#toc_1)\n\n[![Salesforce Pull Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i1.png)\n\nPull settings relate to how Apollo pulls data from your Salesforce instance. Apollo must always pull your leads, contacts, and accounts from Salesforce. This allows Apollo to remove any matches from the Apollo database. It also prevents your team from accidentally prospecting records in Apollo that already exist in Salesforce.\n\nOut of Sight, Out of Mind!\n\nYou cannot disable the automatic pull feature, but you can hide Salesforce leads, contacts, accounts, and opportunities from view in Apollo. For more information, follow the steps in the [Configure Your Salesforce Pull Settings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414496822797-Configure-Your-Salesforce-Pull-Settings%20) article.\n\nWhen Apollo identifies a lead and a contact for the same person in your Salesforce instance, Apollo always pulls the contact, not the lead. This is the only form of deduplication that Apollo runs against your Salesforce instance.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand Salesforce Push Settings[](#toc_2)\n\n[![Salesforce Push Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i2.png)\n\nPush settings relate to how Apollo pushes data from Apollo into your Salesforce instance. Unlike the pull settings, you can [enable or disable Salesforce push settings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414469523981-Configure-Your-Salesforce-Push-Settings).\n\nYou can choose whether to sync all your Apollo-sourced records with Salesforce. However, Apollo always syncs all Salesforce-sourced records with Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Avoid Duplicate Records[](#toc_3)\n\nThere are several key duplication rules to keep in mind before connecting Salesforce.\n\nWhen you integrate Salesforce, Apollo mirrors the data in your Salesforce instance. If you have duplicate leads, contact, or accounts in Salesforce, these same duplicates reflect in Apollo too. To avoid duplicate records post-sync, clean and deduplicate your Salesforce instance before you integrate the 2 platforms.\n\nIf Apollo pulls a duplicate from Salesforce, Apollo displays a potential duplicate message on the contact or account's profile page to notify you. You can also identify the record creation source from the activity log.\n\n[![Duplicate Notification and Record Source](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i4.png)\n\nWhen you manually create a duplicate record in Salesforce, Apollo automatically creates the same record. Likewise, if you enable the Salesforce push settings and create a duplicate record in Apollo, Salesforce creates the same record within your Salesforce instance.\n\nApollo does not automatically delete or merge the duplicates that you manually create. If you decide to delete or merge any of these records, you must do so manually.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Remove Duplicate Records[](#toc_4)\n\nIf duplicate records have already been synced from Salesforce to Apollo, you have 2 options for removing them:\n\n*   **Delete**: If you enable the appropriate settings in Apollo, you can delete duplicate records in either Apollo or Salesforce and the deletion will sync for both.\n*   **Merge**: If you enable the appropriate settings in Apollo, you can merge duplicate records in Salesforce and the changes will sync to Apollo. Once you merge a duplicate, Apollo will only sync information for the remaining record with Salesforce.\n\nTo change these settings, launch Apollo and click **Settings** > [**Integrations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations). Click **View** for the Salesforce integration, and then click **Edit** for the Salesforce authentication settings.\n\nHere, you can adjust the deletion and merge sync settings for the Salesforce integration.\n\n[![Edit the merge and deletion sync settings.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i22.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_salesforce_integration_works_in_apollo/i22.png)\n\nIt Pays to Be Proactive!\n\nIf you pull duplicate records from Salesforce and then [merge them in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4413326420621-Merge-Duplicate-Records-to-Consolidate-Your-Data), Apollo does not merge them in Salesforce.

This only happens if a field is empty and Apollo has relevant information available.\n*   When you select **Auto Overwrite**, Apollo automatically overwrites the existing information in the field from Salesforce with the information within Apollo. This only happens if the information differs between the 2 platforms and Apollo has relevant information available.\n\nTo configure autofill or auto overwrite, refer to the [Map Default Apollo Fields in Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/7699404190221-Map-Apollo-Default-Fields-to-Salesforce) article. Autofill and auto overwrite only run when Apollo pulls information from Salesforce.\n\nManual Has the Last Word\n\nManual actions always take precedence.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nIntegrating HubSpot with Apollo enables you to access and keep your data synchronized within both platforms.\n\nBefore you integrate HubSpot with Apollo though, there are several important details to remember that can help you streamline the setup process and reduce the risk of unnecessary errors when integrating HubSpot.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand HubSpot Pull Settings[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo must always pull your contacts and accounts from HubSpot. This allows Apollo to remove any matches from the Apollo database. It also prevents your team from accidentally prospecting records in Apollo that already exist in HubSpot.\n\nYou can also [manually pull contacts and accounts from HubSpot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416606988941#toc_3) at any time.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand HubSpot Push Settings[](#toc_2)\n\n[![HubSpot Push Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i2.png)\n\nPush settings relate to how Apollo pushes data from Apollo into your HubSpot instance. Unlike the pull settings, you can [enable or disable HubSpot push settings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416606988941#toc_4).\n\nYou can choose whether to sync all your Apollo-sourced records with HubSpot. However, Apollo always syncs all HubSpot-sourced records with Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Avoid Duplicate Records[](#toc_3)\n\nThere are several key duplication rules to keep in mind before connecting HubSpot.\n\nWhen you integrate HubSpot, Apollo mirrors the data in your HubSpot instance. If you have duplicate contacts or accounts in HubSpot, these same duplicates reflect in Apollo too. To avoid duplicate records post-sync, clean and deduplicate your HubSpot instance before you integrate the 2 platforms.\n\nIf Apollo pulls a duplicate from HubSpot, Apollo displays a potential duplicate message on the contact's or account's profile page to notify you. You can also identify the record creation source from the activity log.\n\n[![Duplicate contact message.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i4.png)\n\nWhen you manually create a duplicate record in HubSpot, Apollo automatically creates the same record. Likewise, if you enable the HubSpot push settings and create a duplicate record in Apollo, HubSpot creates the same record within your HubSpot instance.\n\nApollo does not automatically delete or merge the duplicates that you manually create. If you decide to delete or merge any of these records, you must do so manually.\n\nI've Already Got Duplicates!\n\nAs much as you try, you might still have duplicate records in Apollo. To delete or merge duplicate records in Apollo, refer to [Configure HubSpot Basic Settings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416606988941).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Map Fields[](#toc_4)\n\n[![Autofill and Auto Overwrite](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i3.png)\n\nIf you decide to enable autofill or auto overwrite for mapped fields, keep the following in mind:\n\n*   When you select **Autofill**, Apollo automatically uses information within the Apollo database to fill in the field from HubSpot. This only happens if a field is empty and Apollo has relevant information available.\n*   When you select **Auto Overwrite**, Apollo automatically overwrites the existing information in the field from HubSpot with the information within Apollo. This only happens if the information differs between the 2 platforms and Apollo has relevant information available.\n\nAutofill and auto overwrite only run when Apollo pulls information from HubSpot.\n\nManual Has the Last Word\n\nManual actions always take precedence. If you manually enrich a field from the CRM Enrichment page, Apollo pushes that update even if you have disabled the autofill or auto overwrite setting for the field.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## View Errors[](#toc_5)\n\nLeverage the [HubSpot error log in Apollo](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations/hubspot/errors) to view any sync errors that Apollo receives from your HubSpot instance.\n\nThe error log only displays errors that Apollo receives when pushing information to HubSpot. These errors are responses from HubSpot, and they usually indicate a restriction on HubSpot's side, such as hitting a custom validation rule or rate limits for your connected instance.\n\n[![View the error log for the HubSpot integration.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/understand_how_the_hubspot_integration_works_in_apollo/i5.png)\n\nReady to Rock 'n' Roll!\n\nNow that you know more about how the Apollo-HubSpot integration works, you are ready to set up the integration!

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo allows you to sync data to and from Salesforce with your personal Salesforce credentials or with your **Team Sync** credentials. Apollo can synchronize record ownership and activity logs with Salesforce depending on which credentials you use.\n\nConnect Salesforce to Apollo First\n\nPlease note, in order to configure data synchronization between Apollo and Salesforce, you must first connect Salesforce to your Apollo account. Refer to the \"[Connect Apollo to Your Salesforce Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725-Connect-Apollo-to-Your-Salesforce-Account)\" article for additional information.\n\nRefer to the sections below for information about the different types of credentials you can use to synchronize data between Apollo and Salesforce.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Personal Salesforce Credentials[](#toc_2)\n\nThe **My Salesforce Credentials** setting in Apollo is user-specific and represents your personal Salesforce account.\n\n[![My Salesforce Credentials](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/salesforce_credentials/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/salesforce_credentials/i1.png)\n\nOnce you add your Salesforce credentials, Apollo can sync your actions in the platform with your actions in Salesforce when you configure the **[Pull](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414496822797-Configure-Your-Salesforce-Pull-Settings)** and **[Push](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414469523981-Configure-Your-Salesforce-Push-Settings)** settings in your Salesforce integration.\n\nApollo expects that all users with Salesforce accounts will connect their own credentials to sync with Apollo.\n\nOne Set of Salesforce Credentials to an Apollo User\n\nPlease note, you must connect a different set of Salesforce credentials for every user in Apollo. Apollo does not allow 2 or more users to connect with the same Salesforce credentials.\n\nConnecting your personal Salesforce account allows you to sync the following information with the data record:\n\n*   **Ownership**:\u00a0When you are assigned as the owner of a contact or an account in either Apollo or Salesforce, you are shown as the owner in both places. For more information on ownership, see the \"[Which Apollo record owner is assigned to a contact or account in Salesforce?](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415275645069)\" article.\n*   **Logs**: When Apollo logs activity for a contact in Apollo, Salesforce also logs you as the record creator of the corresponding log in Salesforce. This applies to emails, notes, tasks, calls, and meetings/calendar events.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Team Sync Credentials[](#toc_3)\n\nSalesforce **Team Sync** authentication credentials are always applied app-wide for all users. They are used as the primary connection between Apollo and Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce lets you configure many different levels of permissions. It is essential that the login you use for your **Team Sync** authentication credentials belongs to a Salesforce user with both \"read and write\" permissions for all of the objects and fields you're syncing to ensure that Apollo can save them successfully.\n\nAdmin Connections\n\nPlease note, you must first connect a Salesforce account to Apollo before it is available as Salesforce **Team Sync** authentication credentials. If the chosen superuser doesn't have full admin permissions in Salesforce, the Salesforce integration will not work as expected.\n\nFor more information about connecting **Team Sync** credentials to your Salesforce integration, please see the \"[Connect 'Team Sync' Authentication Credentials To Your Salesforce Integration](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415294638733)\" article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Salesforce Record Owner[](#toc_4)\n\nWhether or not you want to authenticate your\u00a0personal Salesforce\u00a0credentials, if you have an existing Salesforce account, you should assign it to your account in your Apollo **You** profile. To update your profile, click **Settings** and then search for your user name in the **Salesforce** section on the \"General\" tab.\n\n[![My Salesforce Credentials](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/salesforce_credentials/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/salesforce_credentials/i4.png)\n\nThis allows Apollo to assign all of the contacts, accounts, or activities that you own to your account once you sync with Salesforce.

If you connect your Apollo account to SendGrid, you do not need to configure a **Tracking Subdomain** because SendGrid manages your tracking links on their end. For additional information, please see the \"[Set Up, Configure, and Troubleshoot Your SendGrid Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414449230093)\" article.\n\nSendGrid and SPAM Filters\n\nPlease note, if your emails are flagged as SPAM when your Apollo account is connected to **SendGrid**, you may need to replace the tracking link in the emails within your **SendGrid** account itself. **SendGrid** includes a feature called **Link Branding** that functions the same as Apollo's **Tracking Subdomain**. This **Link Branding** feature provides the URL that you must replace to reset the deliverability on your account. In this scenario, contact **SendGrid** Technical Support so that they can help you update this configuration and provide any additional information about deliverability within your account.\n\nFor more information about SPAM filters, please read the \"[Avoid SPAM Filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885)\" article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Which SendGrid Plan Do I Choose?[](#toc_9)\n\nThe Apollo integration works with all SendGrid plans, so the world is your oyster!

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nIt Depends on Your Plan\n\nPlease note, if you created your Mailgun account with a domain from an EU server, unfortunately, you cannot currently integrate your Mailgun account with Apollo.\n\nAccess to the Mailgun integration also depends on your Apollo plan. For more information, check out the [pricing comparison chart](https://www.apollo.io/pricing#compare). To upgrade your plan, head to the [manage plan settings](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/plans) in Apollo or reach out to the [Apollo Sales Team](https://apollo.na.chilipiper.com/router/sales_router?leadsource=Inbound&lead_source_details__c=KnowledgeBase) for further guidance.\n\nIf you already actively use Mailgun for transactional or marketing emails, you can integrate your account with Apollo to send higher volumes of emails.\n\n(Remember) Before you set up the Mailgun integration, you need to:\n\n*   [Link your mailbox(es)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io) to Apollo.\n*   Have an active Mailgun account. Head to the [Getting Started](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/sections/200437784-Getting-Started) section of the Mailgun Knowledge Base if you have Mailgun setup questions.\n\nRefer to the following sections for the steps to integrate your Mailgun account with Apollo.\n\n[Back To Top](#top)\n\n## Connect Your Mailgun Account to Apollo[](#toc_2)\n\nTo integrate your Mailgun account with Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo, click **Settings**, and then click the [**Integrations**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations) icon.\n2.  Scroll to Mailgun and then click **Connect**. [![Connect Mailgun Button on Integration Page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i2.png)\n3.  Fill in your Mailgun **primary account API key** and click **Link API key**. [![Link Mailgun Button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i3.png)\n\nGetting the Goods!\n\nPlease keep in mind that the primary account API key must be a private key. If you're not sure where to find your key, fear not! Mailgun has got you covered! Check out the [Where Can I Find My API Key and SMTP Credentials?](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203380100-Where-Can-I-Find-My-API-Key-and-SMTP-Credentials-) article on the Mailgun Knowledge Base. Please also note that Apollo does not support Mailgun domain sending keys. For more information about the different API keys in Mailgun, read [this section](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-intro.html#authentication-1) of the Mailgun API Reference Guide.\n\nYou have now connected your Mailgun account to Apollo.\n\n[![Mailgun Integrated](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i12.png)\n\n(Reminder) Apollo does not support IP whitelisting in Mailgun. If you enable IP whitelisting, you cannot deliver Mailgun messages through Apollo. For more information on IP whitelisting, please read [the IP Reputation/Management section](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/sections/360006037914-IP-Reputation-Management) of the Mailgun Knowledge Base.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Add Mailgun Webhooks for Your Domains[](#toc_3)\n\nYou Snooze, You Lose!\n\nThis is an important step, folks! To ensure full functionality of the Mailgun integration, add a webhook for each domain you use to send emails from in Apollo. But don't worry\u2014it's not as scary as it sounds. Follow the simple steps below, and voila! Like magic, you can start tracking the performance of your [sequences](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837-Sequences-Overview) and identify bounced emails with accuracy to improve your email deliverability rates.\n\nNow that you have connected Mailgun, Apollo displays all the domains connected to your Mailgun account.\n\n[![Mailgun domains](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i13.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i13.png)\n\nTo add Mailgun webhooks for your domains:\n\n1.  Click **Add tracking** next to each of the domains that you want to connect. [![Add webhook button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i15.png)\n2.  You have now added a Mailgun webhook to Apollo. [![Success modal on Mailgun integrations page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i16.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i16.png)\n\nTo delete a connected webhook from Apollo:\n\n1.  Click **Remove tracking**. [![Delete webhook](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i17.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i17.png)\n    \n    Making Lemonade Outta Lemons!\n    \n    Please note, Apollo only automatically pulls in the list of domains from Mailgun when you first integrate Mailgun with Apollo. This means that if you add or delete a domain in Mailgun, the change does not immediately reflect in the list of domains in Apollo. However, no need to panic! If you make any changes in Mailgun, you can click **Refresh List**. Apollo then refreshes the list as well as the status of the Mailgun webhook in Apollo. [![Refresh List button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i14.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i14.png)\n    \n2.  If you try to add or remove a webhook from a domain that no longer exists in Mailgun, Apollo displays an error message. [![Error message](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i18.png)\n    \n    Whoops!\n    \n    Deleted the wrong domain? You'll need to reconnect the domain in Mailgun before you can add the Mailgun webhook in Apollo. For more information about how to add and delete domains in Mailgun, [hop into this article](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203637190-How-Do-I-Add-or-Delete-a-Domain-) in the Mailgun Knowledge Base.\n    \n3.  You can only connect 1 webhook per domain with the Apollo<>Mailgun Integration. If you encounter the following error, you can delete a non-Apollo webhook from Mailgun or manually add the webhook in Mailgun. [![Error message 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i19.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/integrate_mailgun_with_apollo/i19.png)</>\n\nFor more information about how to add or delete webhooks in Mailgun, please refer to the [Guide to Using Mailgun Webhooks](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/product/a-guide-to-using-mailguns-webhooks/#chapter-1) in the Mailgun Knowledge Base. Alternatively, you can use another domain instead.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Enable Mailgun for a Mailbox[](#toc_4)\n\nTo enable Mailgun for a mailbox:\n\n1.  Click **Settings**.

Do you also forward the emails that you send from Mailgun via a secondary domain onto your primary domain? If so, make sure you link both mailboxes with Apollo. If you don't connect your primary domain with Apollo but do forward the emails you send via Mailgun to it, please note that those emails will not appear in Apollo.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nIt's Not For Everyone\n\nPlease note, you must be an admin member to access the IP whitelisting settings in your Apollo account. Access to this feature also depends on your Apollo plan. Please refer to the [Apollo pricing page](https://www.apollo.io/pricing#compare) for more details.\n\nEnable IP whitelisting to restrict unauthorized access to your Apollo account and only give access to the specific IP addresses or ranges you consider trustworthy.\n\nApollo accepts the following formats:\n\n*   Single IP Address\n*   IP Range\n*   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)\n\nIP 101\n\nFeeling a little lost? Here's a quick summary of what these terms mean:\n\n*   **An Internet Protocol (IP) address**: This is a unique number assigned to your device or network to help identify it on the internet. There are 2 types of IP addresses\u2014dynamic, which change automatically as you connect or disconnect from a network\u2014and static, which always remain fixed. Note that if you enable whitelisting and users with dynamic IP addresses try to connect to Apollo after their IP address changes, they cannot access Apollo unless you add the new IP address or range to your whitelist.\n*   **An IP Range**: This is a set of consecutive IP addresses within a local network or assigned to a subnet. If you or your team uses a VPN, contact your IT administrator for guidance on adding your IP range.\n*   **[Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cidr/)**: Otherwise known as supernetting, this is an IP assigning system used by many organizations to increase the efficiency of IP address allocation.\n\nRefer to the following sections to enable or deactivate IP whitelisting, and add or delete IPs from your Apollo whitelist.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Enable IP Whitelisting[](#toc_2)\n\nTo enable IP Whitelisting in Apollo:\n\n1.

Hop into the [Apollo Data Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19331318468621-Apollo-Data-Overview) article for FAQs on all things data at Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Data Sharing Deep-Dive[](#toc_2)\n\n| What Apollo Does Do |\n| --- |\n| Apollo _does_ leverage its large network of over 2 million contributors to improve the scope and accuracy of its database of business contact information and run verification checks that result in a better user experience for its entire customer base. Most of the data we collect from our Apollo users simply forms part of our verification system to check and confirm existing information in the Apollo database. |\n| Apollo _does_ verify data against multiple data sources before adding new information to its database of business contact information. |\n| Apollo _does_ make the most of its powerful engagement tools to collect and verify valid emails against invalid ones to improve the database of business contact information for all. |\n| Apollo _does_ take user privacy extremely seriously and is constantly working to [uphold compliance](https://www.apollo.io/company/privacy-center), [protect privacy](https://www.apollo.io/privacy-policy), and offer [advanced security protocols](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20439872853645-Configure-Advanced-Security-Protocols-For-Your-Team-in-Apollo) for user accounts. |\n\n| What Apollo Does Not Do |\n| --- |\n| Apollo _does not_ read the content of email communications or manually collect any data from customer systems. |\n| Apollo _does not_ leverage user data for any purpose other than to provide services to the user and to improve our services (including the contributor database) for the benefit of all customers. |\n| When Apollo adds any new contact data from its database of business contact information, it _does not_ associate the data with any specific customer. |\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How Frequently Does Apollo Update Its Terms of Services?[](#toc_3)\n\nApollo values its customers and strives to uphold market standards and exceed client expectations as it grows. As a result, Apollo updates its [terms of service](https://www.apollo.io/terms) as necessary with any core releases that impact its product offering, or whenever privacy or other regulations change and necessitate an update.\n\nBy doing so, Apollo ensures that it accurately reflects its services as it introduces innovative new products into its prospecting and engagement suite. Apollo encourages you to regularly check its [terms of service](https://www.apollo.io/terms) to stay current on the latest terms that are broadly applicable to all Apollo users.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## What Data Do I Share When I Use Apollo's Services?[](#toc_4)\n\nThere are a few ways in which you share data with Apollo when you use our services, including:\n\n*   When you [integrate your CRM](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations) or [upload a CSV of contacts](hhttps://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409161532045-Upload-a-CSV-of-Contacts-to-Apollo).\n*   When you [link your mailbox](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/account/mailboxes), including when you [connect your calendar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apolloio-find-b2b-contact/alhgpfoeiimagjlnfekdhkjlkiomcapa).\n\nSome of this data sharing is necessary to access the full functionality of Apollo's [prospecting](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us#category-18201224845965) and [engagement](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us#category-18201371457421) tools. Whereas other aspects are necessary for the broader use of the product by all Apollo users, such as improving the accuracy and scope of Apollo\u2019s [database of business contact information](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19331318468621-Apollo-Data-Overview).

Please reach out to [the Apollo Sales team](https://apollo.na.chilipiper.com/router/sales_router?leadsource=Inbound&lead_source_details__c=KnowledgeBase) if you want to discuss whether a custom plan that excludes these data sharing elements could be a good fit for your company.\n\nIf you connect your [mailbox](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io), [calendar](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423692649101-Use-the-Apollo-Chrome-Extension-in-Google-Calendar), or [CRM](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412668783117-Bi-Directional-Sync-Overview) with Apollo or [upload a CSV of contacts](hhttps://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409161532045-Upload-a-CSV-of-Contacts-to-Apollo), it is because you use Apollo for data enrichment, prospecting, engagement, or sales intelligence. When you opt into these services, you agree to Apollo's [terms of service](https://www.apollo.io/terms) and become part of its network of over [2 million data contributors](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19331318468621-Apollo-Data-Overview#toc_2). As a result, you can take key go-to-market actions like automating emails, creating templates, viewing open rates, attributing success to your booked meetings, viewing job changes, setting up the bi-directional sync of data between your CRM and the data in Apollo, and much more.\n\nIf you choose not to use these features, you can still leverage Apollo for more limited use cases. However, you won't have access to the full functionality and numerous benefits of Apollo's entire product offering. As a result, you would miss out on a lot of the value gained from Apollo\u2019s enrichment and engagement functionality.\n\nPrivacy and Welfare Always Come First\n\nIt's important to note that when you opt into Apollo's contributor network, Apollo takes your privacy and welfare extremely seriously.\n\nFor more information on all things privacy, trust, and security, please refer to the Apollo [Privacy Center](https://www.apollo.io/company/privacy-center) and [Trust Center](https://trust.apollo.io/%0A).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20727684184589-How-Data-Sharing-Works-with-the-Apollo-Data-Contributor-Network"}

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nData is the bread and butter of business at Apollo. As a result, Apollo takes data privacy and compliance very seriously and strives to be fully transparent about how it sources, collects, verifies, and maintains the Apollo database.\n\nHave burning questions about Apollo data? You're in the right spot! Refer to the following sections for more information on all things data at Apollo.\n\n## How Is Apollo Data Sourced and Collected?[](#toc_2)\n\nApollo collects and verifies data against multiple data sources to identify the best source of truth. There are 4 main ways in which Apollo collects data:\n\n*   **Data contributor network**: Apollo has a strong database thanks to its large network of over 2 million data contributors that share information about their business contacts with Apollo in the course of using Apollo services. This means that Apollo can run verification checks against connected inboxes and CRMs.\n*   **Engagement suite**: Apollo's powerful [engagement tools](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10316295330573-Watch-A-Bite-Sized-Apollo-Demo#toc_8) enable it to track email replies and bounces to collect and verify valid emails against invalid ones.\n*   **Public data crawling**: Apollo has proprietary algorithms that regularly crawl the web at scale, parse public-facing websites, and build a web-wide index of people and company data.\n*   **Third-party data providers**: Apollo processes over 270 million records monthly from carefully vetted third-party data providers. These partnerships help to complement Apollo's already highly accurate and ever-growing database with additional high-quality verified data.\n\nAt Apollo, data isn't single-sourced. The combination of its multiple data sources, proprietary algorithms, and data network of over 2 million contributors allow Apollo to provide the best-in-class data coverage and quality.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Living Data Networks](https://www.apollo.io/product/living-data-network) page.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## What Is the Data Coverage on a Specific Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)?[](#toc_3)\n\nThe specific criteria of an ICP varies from company to company. The best way to identify the data coverage on your target audience is to [launch Apollo](https://app.apollo.io/#/people) and apply the [applicable filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview) to a search.\n\n[![Search Filters](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/data_overview/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/data_overview/i1.png)\n\nApollo then loads the total number of records that match the criteria of your ICP.\n\nHold the Phone\u2014What's an ICP?\n\nAn [Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416471135245-Identify-Your-Ideal-Customer-Profile-ICP) is a fictitious company that combines the key characteristics that best portray your ideal customer. By analyzing firmographics such as company size, industry, location, annual revenue, and budget, you can more easily define the types of companies that you serve best.\n\n**(Recommended)** Apply the [email status filter](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423314404621-Email-Status-Overview) to your search to find [Apollo-verified](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381-How-Apollo-Verifies-Emails) emails.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How Does Apollo Ensure Data Is Accurate?[](#toc_4)\n\nLead data is Apollo's bread and butter. The Apollo team constantly improves and refines how it collects and verifies data to provide its users with a best-in-class solution.\n\nApollo's proprietary approach and automated multi-step verification process help it maintain a highly accurate database and keep records up-to-date. The secret potion includes:\n\n*   A 7-step email verification process to identify valid emails within catch-all domains, verify data in real-time, predict email bounces, and automatically clean invalid emails. Learn more about Apollo's [email verification process here](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381).\n*   An automated, real-time verification process for direct dial requests. Apollo's proprietary algorithm runs the number through multiple checks using its large dataset to verify a number's accuracy.\n*   The instant refresh of contact and company information every time a data signal, such as a job change or a new direct dial or email, informs Apollo of an update.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How Often Does Apollo Update Its Data?[](#toc_5)\n\nApollo takes data accuracy and compliance very seriously. As a result, Apollo:\n\n*   Refreshes data in real-time whenever the Apollo system captures a data signal, such as a job change or a new phone number or email. This signal triggers the system to check for new data and verify its validity.\n*   Runs monthly checks on its database to ensure that contact data stays accurate and up-to-date.\n*   Regularly refreshes its database for individuals who request to opt out of Apollo services and from third parties who pass along opt-out requests from individuals to Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Why Do Third-Party Email Verification Vendors Flag Apollo\u2019s Verified Emails as Invalid?[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you use a third-party tool in conjunction with Apollo, you may find that the tool flags some Apollo-verified emails as invalid. This is because the majority of popular tools use a method called [SMTP tickling](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381-How-Apollo-Verifies-Emails#toc_1), which cannot differentiate between valid and invalid emails from [catch-all domains](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381-How-Apollo-Verifies-Emails#toc_7).\n\nWithin Apollo's [7-step email verification process](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381-How-Apollo-Verifies-Emails#toc_4), Apollo leverages its powerful engagement tools to track email replies and bounces. This means that Apollo can collect and verify valid emails within catch-all domains. For more information, refer to the [How Apollo Verifies Emails](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/10826699994381-How-Apollo-Verifies-Emails) article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How Can a User Claim or Remove Their Profile in the Apollo Database?[](#toc_7)\n\nAccurate data also means compliant data. Apollo takes opt-out requests and regulations seriously and has implemented the following practices:\n\n1.  A clear, transparent, and consumer-friendly opt-out request process. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.apollo.io/company/privacy-center/). Apollo processes opt-out requests promptly to ensure its data is up-to-date with consumer opt-out rights.\n2.  Once an opt-out occurs, Apollo deletes the contact from its database. Apollo then retains their email address solely to respect their opt-out preference and ensure they do not reappear in the Apollo database.\n3.  Customers can and should filter data based on location. In Apollo, you can target your use of the Apollo dataset to certain locales, industries, people, or businesses where you have a legitimate interest in reaching out and where your reach-outs are compliant with local law.\n\nPrivacy Matters\n\nHead to the [the privacy center](https://www.apollo.io/company/privacy-center/) if you want to submit a request for information access or request to remove your profile from the Apollo database. The Apollo privacy team will then take action accordingly.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Does Apollo Notify Contacts When It Adds Them to Its Database?[](#toc_8)\n\nApollo automatically sends an email notification to every new contact in certain regions\u2014such as the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland\u2014when it adds them to its database.\n\nSubject to notification requirements, the email explains how Apollo processes contact data and informs the contacts of their rights.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How Does Apollo's Data Compare to Others?[](#toc_9)\n\nApollo consistently expands and refines its database to offer you the most accessible, trustworthy B2B data. To identify the best source of truth, Apollo collects and verifies data against multiple data sources as well as via its:\n\n*   Network of over 2 million data contributors.\n*   Email engagement tools.\n*   Verified third-party data providers.\n*   Crawling of public data sources.\n\nCompared to other B2B databases, Apollo offers over 65+ data attribute filters so you can find and reach your entire target market.\n\nLet's Go Head to Head!\n\nFor a data comparison of Apollo vs. others, refer to the \"Battle Royale\" section of [this customer story](https://www.apollo.io/customer-stories-overview/census).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Why Does Apollo Display Guessed Emails?[](#toc_10)\n\nApollo strives to help you connect with as many of your ideal customers as possible. As a result, whenever Apollo cannot fully verify an email but finds multiple pieces of evidence that suggest a probable email, Apollo marks it as guessed and indicates the confidence level. Apollo only returns guessed emails if the confidence level is 50% or above.\n\nUse the guessed filter with caution to keep your [domain safe](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-SPAM-Filters). If you don't want to include any guessed emails in your sales outreach, you can filter contacts by [email status](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423314404621-Email-Status-Overview).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Why Do I Have a High Bounce Rate for Emails Sent Via a Mailbox Connected to Apollo?[](#toc_11)\n\nIf you notice a high bounce rate from the emails you send via a mailbox connected to Apollo, you need to take action to lower the number of bounces and protect your sending reputation.\n\nHow High is High?\n\nAs a point of reference, if you consistently notice a bounce rate of 8% or above\u2014cue the alarm bells! It's time to act fast to keep your domain safe and sound.\n\nMultiple factors can contribute to high bounce rates. Refer to [this article](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409227148045-Why-Do-I-See-Such-a-High-Bounce-Rate-for-Emails-from-Apollo-) for more information on the potential causes and steps to take to rectify any issues you may be facing.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## What Permissions Does Apollo Need Access To When I Connect My Email or Calendar?[](#toc_12)\n\nTo access the full functionality of Apollo prospecting and engagement tools, it is necessary to link your business email and calendar with your Apollo account.\n\nApollo never deletes your emails or calendars. However, as providers like Google bundle all access as a single group of permissions, Apollo cannot request individual permissions for the specific privileges it needs to ensure Apollo features function correctly.\n\nIt is important to understand that when you link your email or calendar, Apollo may use automated algorithms to extract certain personal information from your email and calendar content and related metadata, which may be added to Apollo's contributory data network. However, this data is never tied to a specific customer. Apollo only adds a piece of data to its database if multiple separate users and accounts have the same verified information for that contact, account, or industry.\n\nWhen you give Apollo the necessary access and permissions, Apollo can help you to:\n\n*   [**Mailbox**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io): Automate emails, create templates and follow-ups, view open rates, and more.\n*   [**Google Calendar**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4423692649101-Use-the-Apollo-Chrome-Extension-in-Google-Calendar): Empower contacts to book meetings with you through the Apollo meetings scheduler, attribute success to your booked meetings, view job changes, and more.\n\nFor more information about data sharing with Apollo, please refer to [this article](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409127806093-Link-Your-Mailbox-to-Apollo-io).\n\nNeed a Helping Hand?\n\nGot this far but couldn't find the answer you're looking for?

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nWe're Fine Tuning the Magic Formula!\n\nPlease note, this feature is currently only available for new direct dial requests. Apollo is working hard behind the scenes to bring you Do Not Call screening for your existing, saved numbers as well as the numbers in your connected CRM, so stay tuned for further updates.\n\nTo help you stay compliant and give you more visibility, Apollo offers screening against US and UK Do Not Call (DNC) lists for new phone numbers that you request.\n\nRefer to the following steps to turn on DNC screening and see the feature in action when you request new direct dial numbers in Apollo.\n\nAdmin Only\n\nPlease note, only admin users can activate DNC screening in Apollo. If you do not have access but want to turn the feature on for your team, please contact an admin.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Turn On DNC Screening For UK and US Numbers[](#toc_2)\n\nOn the Other Side of the Pond?\n\nBased in the UK and wondering what all this DNC business is about? Fear not! When you turn on the **Do Not Call** toggle and request a new direct dial, Apollo displays the **Do Not Call** tag for any numbers on the US Do Not Call registry or the UK Telephone Preference Service (TPS). It's the same concept, just a different name for our friends across the pond. The steps below still apply. For more information on the DNC registry, refer to the [Federal Trade Commission website](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/qa-telemarketers-sellers-about-dnc-provisions-tsr-0). To learn more about the TPS, please refer to the [TPS website](https://www.tpsonline.org.uk/pages/what_is_tps).\n\nTo turn on the DNC screening of new direct dial numbers for you and your team:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and then click **Settings** > [**Prospecting Config**.](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/org)\n2.  Scroll to **DNC list screening** and click the toggle to activate it. [![DNC Toggle](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i1.png)\n3.  You have now turned on DNC list screening for your new direct dial requests in Apollo.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Direct Dial Requests[](#toc_3)\n\nIf you turn on DNC screening, Apollo runs the number against the DNC registry when you request a new direct dial in Apollo. If the number is on the registry, Apollo displays a **Do Not Call** tag in the following 3 places:\n\n1.  From the search page, when you hover your mouse over the dialer icon of a saved contact or account. [![Do not call tag on search screen](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i4.png)\n2.  From a contact's profile page.

From within your active tasks.

If you activate the toggle and a number you request is on the UK or US registry, Apollo still charges you 1 credit for the request. It is then at your discretion to decide if you call the contact or not.\n\nDNC screening provides add-on value to help you identify which numbers are protected against telemarketing and should only be contacted for [a permitted reason](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/qa-telemarketers-sellers-about-dnc-provisions-tsr-0).\n\nMake Sure You're Sure!\n\nPlease note, you can call any direct dial number from the [Apollo dialer](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409140527757-Configure-the-Dialer). However, unless you have a permitted reason to contact the prospect, Apollo advises that you do not call contacts on the DNC registry. Additionally, if Apollo notifies you that a contact has requested to be removed from the Apollo database, you should not contact them unless you have a separate legal basis to do so. You are responsible for ensuring that any call that you make from the Apollo dialer is compliant with law.\n\n### Request a Direct Dial in Apollo[](#toc_4)\n\nTo request a direct dial number in Apollo and identify if a number is on the DNC list:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Search**](https://app.apollo.io/#/people). Then, [apply filters](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412665755661-Search-Filters-Overview) to your search.\n2.  Scroll to the **Phone** column next to a contact's details and click **Request Mobile Number**.

Apollo displays the company number and initiates the verification process for the direct dial. Apollo may take a few minutes to verify the contact's mobile number. [![Direct dial verification](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/enable_dnc_list_screening/i6.png)\n4.

{"text": "## Watch the Video[](#toc_0)\n\n## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo Meetings empowers your prospects to schedule meetings with you in seconds. When you sync your calendar with Apollo, you can manage your availability for meetings, create different types of meetings, and view your scheduled meetings.\n\nThere are several advantages of leveraging meetings in your sales workflow, including:\n\n*   **Streamline the Scheduling Workflow**: Sync your calendar, configure your default meeting settings, and set your availability for each type of meeting to automate the scheduling process.\n*   **Encourage Proactive Engagement**: Make it easy for your prospects to reach you first so you can spend more time engaging in meaningful conversations and less time on administrative tasks.\n*   **Facilitate Ease of Attendance**: Eliminate friction between third-party platforms and reduce the risk of no-shows with automated meeting reminders.\n\nRefer to the following sections for an overview of the different Meetings features available.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Meeting Types[](#toc_2)\n\nMeeting types are the different meetings that you want to host. This is useful if you want to encourage different types of contacts to schedule different types of meetings with you. Example meeting types could include scoping calls, demos, brainstorming sessions, and partnership meetings.\n\nLeverage meeting types to remain in control of your schedule and provide your prospects with more context about the type of meetings they can book with you.\n\n[![Meeting Types Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i15.png)\n\nUp to Your Eyeballs in Meetings?\n\nTrying to keep on top of all those many meetings? You can create numerous meeting types to help you clearly define the types of meetings participants can schedule with you. If you are on a free plan, you can activate up to 6 meeting types at a time.\n\nHowever, if you are on a paid plan, the world is your oyster! You can create and activate as many meeting types as you need.\n\nThere are 3 different types of meetings that you can create:\n\n*   **Single-host**: This meeting type only ever has one host. Single-host meetings should be used for one-on-one discussions with your prospect.\n*   **Multi-host**: This meeting type has multiple hosts that co-host the meeting. When a prospect schedules a meeting of this type, all hosts must be available at the same time for the calendar slot to be available.\n*   **Round robin host**: This meeting type rotates between different hosts each time it is used to schedule a meeting. Round-robin meetings should also be used for one-on-one discussions. You can choose to rotate hosts based on either the availability of hosts for certain time slots or the equal distribution of hosts so that each host is booked as part of a rotation one by one.\n\nWhen you create a **Meeting Type**, you can specify the duration of the call, provide the appropriate meeting links, add a description, and set your availability.\n\nLet's Get Those Meetings Started!\n\nFor more information about how to manage, edit, and personalize your meeting types, follow the steps in the [Manage Your Meetings in Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173-Manage-Your-Meetings-in-Apollo) article.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Scheduled Meetings[](#toc_3)\n\nGo to the **Scheduled Meetings** tab to view your upcoming meetings and keep track of the meetings that you previously attended.

By setting up the appropriate logic for your inbound routers, you can ensure that specific prospects can easily schedule meeting with the right teams or sales reps.\n\nOnly Apollo admins can create inbound routers. Other users can be assigned meetings via inbound routers and view them, but cannot create them.\n\n[![Inbound routers for meetings.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i35.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i35.png)\n\nIn addition to inbound routers, you can also [integrate your own web forms with Apollo](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/19083452478733). With this option, prospects enter information into the web forms that you build on your own websites, and then schedule meetings with your team as they would with the inbound router workflow.\n\nApollo provides a JavaScript snippet that connects your web form to Apollo meetings. You will need a resource knowledgeable in front-end web engineering to help build the integration on your website.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Settings[](#toc_5)\n\nTo update your meeting settings, go to the **Settings** tab. From here, you can view your connected calendar, personalize your meeting link, edit your video conference link, adjust your default availability, and set your minimum schedule notice to avoid participants from booking you up at the last minute.\n\n[![Settings Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i17.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i17.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Admin Console[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you are an Apollo admin, the **Admin console** tab enables you to view and edit all of the meeting types, inbound routers, and intake forms that you have created for your organization from a single location.\n\n[![Admin Console Tab](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i20003.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i20003.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Meetings in Gmail[](#toc_7)\n\nIf you install the [Apollo Chrome Extension](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409154350477-Download-and-Install-the-Apollo-Chrome-Extension), you can use meeting functionality directly in Gmail. The **Meetings** tab in the Chrome extension enables you to:\n\n*   Provide a link in your email for one of your single-host meetings. The guest can book any time you have availability based on the chosen meeting's settings.\n*   Set aside specific times for a meeting. The guest can only book the times you make available, and in the meantime, you can make sure those times are not scheduled for any other purpose.\n\n[![Add meeting links to emails.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the_apollo_chrome_extension_in_gmail/i40.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_the_apollo_chrome_extension_in_gmail/i40.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## FAQ: Help Prospects Add Meeting Invites to Their Calendars[](#toc_8)\n\nEmail providers, including Google and Microsoft, might prevent meeting invites from being automatically added to prospects' calendar. For example, Google provides users the ability to control whether invites are automatically added to Calendar based on whether they have previously interacted with an email address. If a prospect books a meeting with you and never receives the meeting invitation, these settings could be causing the problem.\n\nIf a prospect does not receive a meeting invitation, first tell them to check the spam folder of their mailbox.\n\nFor Google mailboxes, advise them to click the **I know the sender** option in the email if they find the invitation. This adds the sender to Google Calendar's safe sender list, which means future invites from the same email address will be automatically added to the prospect's calendar.\n\n[![Add the sender to the safe list in Google Calendar.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/apollo_meetings_overview/i5.png)\n\nIf a prospect prefers to automatically add meeting invites from all senders to their calendar, advise them to change the **Add invitations to my calendar** setting in Google Calendar to **From everyone**. Provide Google's [Manage invitations in Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/13159188) support article to help them change the setting.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/8797408392589"}
{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nA tracking domain is a secondary (or sub) domain name related to your original domain. It allows Apollo to redirect a tracking pixel added to emails to track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.\n\nTracking pixels are often flagged as spam. Set up a custom tracking subdomain to improve the delivery rates for the emails you send through Apollo.\n\nRefer to the sections below to create, connect, and manage a new tracking subdomain.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create a Custom Tracking Subdomain[](#toc_2)\n\nTo create a custom tracking subdomain, you need to first create a CNAME record. To do so, you need admin access to your domain management account.\n\nDomain Management Interface\n\nPlease note, every domain provider has a different domain management interface. If you need help creating a CNAME record, visit the online knowledge base for your domain provider and search for \"create CNAME\".\n\nThe table below provides more details about the type of information you will need.\n\n| Field | Definition | Field Information | Additional Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **DNS Record Type** | DNS Records include essential information about your domain or host. To set up a tracking subdomain, you need to select the record type: **Canonical Name (CNAME)**. | CNAME | A CNAME record maps an alias name to a canonical domain name. |\n| **Host/Host Name/Name** | Choose any name that is not directly related to your website. This name will become the subdomain in the URL that you create: subdomain.yourdomain.com | `subdomainexample` | *   Do not include spaces.<br>*   This must be text only.<br>*   Do not include periods.<br>*   Do not include any words that SPAM filters can easily identify, such as `tracking`. |\n| **Value/Data/Points To** | The value you enter establishes the connection between your subdomain and the Apollo tracking servers. | `aplolinks.com` | This field must be `aplolinks.com`. |\n| **TTL** | TTL is a technical term that refers to how often your subdomain information will be rechecked by relevant servers. | Leave as Default | You can leave this field as whatever value your domain provider uses by default. |\n\nAs an example, here's the layout from an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, one of the most popular providers. You will need to add data into all of the same CNAME record fields. Once you create and save your CNAME record, it can take between 2-24 hours to fully propagate.\n\n[![Create CNAME example](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_a_custom_tracking_subdomain_URL/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_a_custom_tracking_subdomain_URL/i1.png)\n\nFields May Vary\n\nIf you're using other providers like GoDaddy or Cpanel, reference their documentation on subdomains to ensure you're reviewing the most up-to-date information specific to your use case.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Connect a Custom Subdomain to Apollo[](#toc_3)\n\nTo connect a custom subdomain to Apollo:\n\n1.

For this reason, Apollo tracking stats reflect data from the previous week and month rather than from the current week and month.\n\n### Deactivate a Tracking Subdomain[](#toc_8)\n\nTracking Subdomain Status\n\nIf your tracking subdomain is **Healthy**, your recipients\u2019 email servers are not flagging your emails as spam. When you check your [email statistics](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409233647373-Sequence-Statistics-Overview#toc_3) in Apollo, you should see high open rates and low bounce rates. If your tracking subdomain is **Unhealthy**, your recipients\u2019 email servers are flagging your emails as spam.\n\nYou can expect that email servers will still occasionally flag your emails as spam. If you start to see a dramatic decrease in your open rates or an increase in spam-blocked emails, you can follow the instructions in the [Create a Custom Tracking Subdomain](#1) section to create a new tracking subdomain. Then deactivate the current tracking subdomain to remove it from your options and reset your deliverability. Also, remember to follow [email deliverability best practices](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-Spam-Filters#toc_3) to avoid that pesky spam filter.\n\nTo deactivate a tracking subdomain, click the **additional options (...)** button on the right-hand side of the tracking subdomain.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nYour sales teams have ambitious goals to meet, whether that be scheduling a certain number of meetings or sending a certain number of emails to prospects. Apollo\u2019s goal tracking helps your teams meet those goals.\n\nSales managers can set goals for emails sent and meetings scheduled. Sales managers set goals for their entire team, so these goals should be applied to all team members at the same time. Then, the Apollo control center shows how the team is progressing against those goals.\n\n[![Team goals overview.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i2.png)\n\nThe following sections detail how to set goals for your team in Apollo and track those goals.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Map Salesforce Stages to Apollo[](#toc_1)\n\nSalesforce Integration Required\n\nApollo relies on Salesforce stages to track the goals you set, which means you need to integrate Salesforce to Apollo to use this feature. Refer to [Connect Apollo to Your Salesforce Account](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414356051725) to get started setting up the integration.\n\nTo map your Salesforce stages to Apollo:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click **Settings** >\u00a0[**Goals**](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/goals).\n2.  Click the checkbox for each stage you want to map from Salesforce to Apollo. Then, click **Save**. [![Map Salesforce stages to Apollo.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i11.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Set Goals in Apollo[](#toc_2)\n\nTo set goals for your team:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Home**](https://app.apollo.io/#/control-center).\n2.  Make sure that you are in the **Sales manager control center**. [![Access the Sales manager control center.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i12.png)\n3.  Click **Set goal**.

Enter a name for your goal, add the team members you want to measure against the goal, and decide whether you want to measure on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis.\n    \n    Then, click **Next**. [![Enter your team details.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i14.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/track_team_goals/i14.png)\n    \n    There is No I in Team\n    \n    Team goals are truly for the entire team. The goals you set are for the team as a whole, not for individuals.\n    \n    For example, if you set a weekly goal of 50 emails for 5 team members, the 5 individuals need to combine to send a total of 50 emails. If a single team member sends 20 emails, they have contributed 40% towards your weekly email goal!\n    \n5.  Set your team goals for emails sent and, if you choose, meetings set. You are not required to set a goal for meetings. To better inform your decisions, Apollo shows the previous performance of your selected team members in terms of average meetings set and emails sent. This data includes up to 200 previous instances of the timeframe you set, whether that be weeks, months, or quarters.\n    \n    You can also choose to receive email updates about how the team is progressing towards the goals set.\n    \n    Then, click **Next**.

To measure the performance of the emails your team sends, set a benchmark percentage for each of the 4 email rates benchmarks. All email benchmarks need to be set to a number above 0.\n    \n    Toggle the **Email notification** slider on to receive email updates for a specific rate. If you opted out of Apollo emails in the past, updating the email notification preferences will resubscribe you only to the email notifications that you choose here.\n    \n    Then, click **Next**.

Apollo calculates the number of meetings that have been set in the designated time period.\n\nThe email rates benchmark metrics vary based on how each benchmark is calculated:\n\n*   **Deliver rate**: The number of emails that have been delivered divided by the number of emails that have been sent. For example, 100 emails delivered / 105 emails sent = 95% deliver rate.\n*   **Open rate**: The number of emails that have been opened divided by the number of emails that have been delivered.\n*   **Reply rate**: The number of emails that have received replies divided by the number of emails that have been delivered.\n*   **Interested rate**: The number of emails that have been marked as interested divided by the number of positive replies and/or meetings booked.\n\nYou might see differences in open, reply, and interested rates when comparing them in the Apollo Control Center and sequence reports.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/20676039270541-Set-and-Track-Team-Goals-in-Apollo"}

This means that you can save and export up to 300,000 **accounts** in your Apollo instance without paying a penny.\n\nApollo provides you with a monthly allowance of credits based on the terms of your billing cycle and the type of Apollo plan that you are on.

The more A/B tests a sequence has, the better for your sender reputation and [deliverability score](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/23432467200781-Improve-Your-Email-Deliverability). Varied messages tend to indicate authenticity instead of spam. So while A/B tests can help you fine-tune your messaging to resonate with each persona, they can also improve your [sender score](https://www.apollo.io/academy/mastering-email-deliverability). For more deliverability tips, check out our [email deliverability checklist](https://www.apollo.io/files/cold-email-deliverability-checklist.pdf).\n\nCheck out the following sections to use A/B tests in a sequence.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Use an A/B Test in a Sequence[](#toc_2)\n\nFirst, [create a sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101-Create-a-Sequence) or use an existing sequence. Then, add an A/B test:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences). Select a sequence.\n\n[![Sequences](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i10.png)\n\n2.  Add an automatic or manual email step, then click **Add A/B Test** on the step you want to test.\n\nWatch Your Step\n\nYou can only A/B test email steps. It isn't possible to A/B test other sequence steps or an entire sequence flow.\n\n[![The add a b test button is highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i11.png)\n\n3.

Click the email.\n\n[![An example new blank email is highlighted](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i12.png)\n\n4.  Edit the email template or use the AI assistant to generate content. When finished, click **Save**.\n\n[![An example email template is shown on the editor page](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i13.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i13.png)\n\nTo B or Not To B\n\nTo effectively identify what is and isn't working at speed and scale, begin by A/B testing wildly different email templates. Then iterate on the templates of the best-performing messages by A/B testing more specific variables like individual subject lines or body text. Learn more in our master class on [building a world-class outbound program](https://www.apollo.io/academy/building-a-world-class-outbound-program).\n\n5.  After editing your message, toggle the emails on.\n\n[![A B emails are toggled on](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i14.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i14.png)\n\n6.  Apollo evenly distributes each message variant in the A/B test to different contacts in the sequence step.\n\nRepeat this process for additional emails and sequence steps. Then, observe the delivery data Apollo collects for each email. When you've collected enough data, you can determine the best-performing messages, and deactivate underperforming content.\n\nHow Much Data is Enough?\n\nRather than A/B test an arbitrary number like 100 or 200 delivered messages, optimize by testing an amount that is statistically significant. [Online calculators](https://abtestguide.com/calc/) can help determine statistical significance. Then, only determine an A/B test winner if you have a 90% or greater confidence interval. Learn more in lesson 5 of the [Build a World Class Outbound Program](https://www.apollo.io/academy/building-a-world-class-outbound-program) Master Class.\n\nIn general, higher performing content will have higher delivery and interested rates, and lower spam blocked and opt out rates.\n\n[![Example delivery data is shown for 2 a b test emails](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/ab_testing/i15.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410749683597-Add-an-A-B-Test-to-an-Email-Step-in-a-Sequence"}

{"text": "## What is GDPR?[](#toc_1)\n\nThe [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/) is a privacy regulation enacted by the European Union (EU) in April of 2016 to protect member country citizens and their right to privacy and control over their personal data in the digital world.\n\nThe internet and the way we use it have changed a lot since the first privacy laws were created in the 90s. It is the EU\u2019s hypothesis that allowing citizens more control over their digital footprint will foster more trust in online business. This should increase the citizens' likelihood of conducting business with them and thereby increase the digital economy.\n\nThe regulation went into effect on May 25, 2018, and the potential financial penalties for failure to comply are steep. The sections below provide a high-level overview of important terms, impacts, and how Apollo participates in GDPR.\n\nGDPR Legislation\n\nIf you would like to read the actual text for the General Data Protection Regulation in its most recent form, please visit [EU GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) website.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Why is GDPR important?[](#toc_2)\n\nGDPR is important because it likely affects many people more than they realize. The safest assumption to make is that GDPR affects your company in at least some capacity, especially if you work for a company established in the EU, a company that sells to people within the EU, or a company that monitors the actions of citizens of the EU regardless of where your headquarters is or where you send marketing emails from.\n\nFailure to adhere to GDPR guidelines can be expensive. The highest amount a single company could pay is 4% of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is **higher**. Lower-tiered fines apply to lower-level penalties and can be the equivalent of 2% of global turnover or 10 million euros.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## GDPR Terminology Glossary[](#toc_3)\n\nUse the glossary below to help make sense of the important terms contained in the GDPR.\n\n*   **Consent**: Contacts in the EU must provide explicit permission before you can contact them. If contact information was gained through a third party, the source must be specified at first contact with the Data Subject.\n*   **Cross-Border Data Transfer**: Sending data and/or personal information outside of EU/EAA borders\n*   **Data Subject**: A natural person and citizen of the EU whose information has been collected and can be identified by a data controller.\n*   **Data Controller**: Controllers include parties who manage personal data or collect personal data. Apollo and Apollo's customers are considered data controllers.\n*   **Data Portability**: A data subject\u2019s right to their own personal data from the data controller in a familiar, machine-readable format\n*   **Data Processor**: A party that is instructed by the controller in how personal data should be handled and used. Apollo is also considered a data processor.\n*   **Data Subject Rights**: New rights within the GDPR include the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, and the right to object to profiling.\n*   **GDPR Articles**: The GDPR includes two sections\u2014the recitals and the Articles. The Articles include the text of the legislation and the Privacy Management Activities (PMAs) that are required for compliance.\n*   **Personal Data**: Personal data included in Apollo typically includes name, company address, company phone number, email address, and IP address.\n*   **Privacy by Design and Default**: Companies have an obligation to keep data privacy top-of-mind throughout the design process and to build default and adequate privacy controls into all new features.\u00a0\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## GDPR's Effect On Sales Teams[](#toc_4)\n\nA key element of the GDPR that can cause business friction is the gravity of consent that is required from individuals. Specifically, in order to collect and handle (or to \u201cprocess\u201d) personal data of Europeans, marketers, and services like Apollo must have a \u201clegal basis.\u201d\n\nTwo common legal bases include:\n\n1.  Consent of the data subject\n2.  A \u201clegitimate interest\u201d to use the data that is not outweighed by fundamental \u201crights and freedoms,\u201d taking into account data subjects\u2019 \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of how data may be used \u00a0\n\nThe GDPR cites \u201cdirect marketing\u201d as an example of a likely \u201clegitimate interest.\u201d\n\nMany legal commentators have noted that the GDPR leaves many questions unanswered and the potential for courts to resolve those questions in the years to come. Based on the best legal interpretations as of today, Apollo (and many others) believe that under this balancing test, most B2B marketing like newsletters and most direct marketing is protected as a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d if executed in a thoughtful way.\n\nOn the other hand, campaigns that are not targeted in a way that is likely to be useful to someone given their industry or position may not fit a \u201clegitimate interest.\u201d It will, therefore, be more important than ever for B2B marketers to use data wisely and tailor campaigns and marketing to be relevant.\n\nThese elements are also only relevant for prospects located in the EU so you don't need to worry about any of these regulations if you\u2019re emailing anyone outside the GDPR\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## How does Apollo adhere to GDPR?[](#toc_5)\n\nThe Apollo team works hard to ensure that we remain in compliance for both the company's benefit as well as that of our customers. The Apollo platform is more complex in the way that it handles data than most, so our compliance is similarly complicated.\n\nOur [**Privacy Policy**](https://www.apollo.io/privacy-policy//) and [**Terms of Service**](https://apollo.io/terms/) include our **Data Processing Addendum**. The addendum helps users control what we do with their data and gives them the freedom to access and/or remove their data from our system if they so desire, among other rights.\n\nMuch of maintaining GDPR compliance as a vendor involves how we secure our data. In order to maintain a high bar of security we have completed the following:\n\n*   Apollo has achieved a SOC 2 and ISO 27001 security accreditation report. These accreditations evaluate Apollo controls that are relevant to data security, availability, and confidentiality. To gain them, Apollo needed to prove the success of our controls and their ability to maintain security, availability, and confidentiality over a predetermined span of time.\n*   Apollo has implemented advanced data controls, which include the encryption of all user data, which is designed to protect our customers\u2019 data from leaks and malicious intent. The Apollo team regularly tests our product to fix any potential problems and maintains the industry\u2019s highest standards in information security.\n*   Apollo has built and follows data incident response processes. These processes are tested each year for continued effectiveness.\n*   Apollo built processes to supplement data recovery and integrity to help any customers whose data is lost or unintentionally corrupted.\n*   Apollo has systems in place to protect all customers' rights to their own data footprint in the platform.\n*   Apollo\u2019s key data sub-processors, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform, all have achieved similarly high-level security standards (SOC 2 and/or ISO 27001 certifications, where possible) and have undergone rigorous security evaluations.\n\nGDPR lays out different requirements for \u201cProcessors\u201d and \u201cControllers\u201d of data. In Apollo's case, we operate as both a data controller and data processor since we help our users acquire data as a controller and communicate with prospects as a processor.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Apollo's Adherence to GDPR as Data \u201cControllers\u201d[](#toc_6)\n\nAs it stands, Apollo is in compliance as a data controller by the standards contained in the GDPR. Apollo manages the data we collect to ensure it is in compliance. We also view it as our responsibility to educate everyone who uses our data to keep them informed and prepared to use our data in a way that similarly keeps them in compliance.\n\nOur users have the option of excluding citizens of member countries within the EU to help protect themselves against accidentally emailing someone they shouldn\u2019t. This prevents our customers from having to comb through lists of prospects to double-check their own compliance while prospecting.\n\nApollo customers that sell or market to EU citizens must be transparent in their intentions with any personal data that they collect and must have consent from individuals before sending them any information. If they do send any form of communication, they must also provide the ability for people to opt out of any future messages. If our customers also use Apollo as their sales engagement platform, they have the ability to include opt-out links within their emails.\n\nApollo has the ability to enrich data pertaining to citizens of the EU should our users already possess their contact information. For example, if a user has the email address and name of an individual working for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris, we have the ability to enrich title and company information. With that said, this ability is only applicable if the enrichment is for the purpose of data hygiene and cleanliness or if you have a good faith reason to believe that the recipient has a demonstrated interest in receiving the information or offer, such as information that would help them perform their job.\n\nAs data controllers, Apollo maintains our own compliance and aids users with their own compliance, but Apollo highly recommends that all of our customers familiarize themselves with the regulations and seek out additional support from privacy advisors if any questions remain.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Apollo's Adherence to GDPR as Data \u201cProcessors\u201d[](#toc_7)\n\nBeyond the precautions and measures laid out above, Apollo has completed and will undertake the following actions to maintain compliance as a data processor:\n\n*   Working with our legal counsel (and when requested, those of our customers) to ensure full preparation and compliance.\n*   Evaluating every use case within our platform to help back up every decision we make should they face legal scrutiny.\n*   Crafting internal workflows to quickly and thoroughly complete data subject requests\n*   Conducting an in-depth review of all requirements implications for data processors and where we may be a joint controller\n*   Updating all contact information and notices so data subjects and customer data controllers may contact us if necessary\n*   Obtaining all resources necessary for ongoing compliance requirements and documentation necessitated by GDPR\n*   Updating and maintaining data security standards and workflows to meet all requirements necessitated by GDPR\n*   Evaluating all customer contracts where necessary to ensure we\u2019ve laid out a path for legal compliance for them to the best of our ability and to clearly detail our own responsibilities to avoid any possible confusion that could result in a penalty.\n\nWe are aware that laws and regulations could continue to change, so we will continue the work of maintaining compliance and will help our customers do the same.\n\nWhen in doubt, your best course of action is to talk to attorneys well-versed in the data-privacy space or with a data-specific officer. For all Apollo-related questions, we\u2019re more than happy to help.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409141087757"}

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nUse table layouts to customize the data you view when prospecting in Apollo. You can create private and public custom table layouts for your specific use cases and apply them to new and saved searches.\n\nWhether you manage a go-to-market team or are a solo selling machine, if you use the Apollo search tool, you can take advantage of customized table layouts.\n\n[![Table Layout Modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_a_custom_layout_for_your_searches/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_a_custom_layout_for_your_searches/i1.png)\n\n### Example Use Case[](#toc_2)\n\nThe information you want to view in a search varies from use case to use case. Here are 2 examples that help demonstrate why you might want to customize your table layouts when prospecting:\n\nLet's say you are a sales rep. You create a saved search for contacts in North America actively searching with buying intent. You want to engage with net new contacts that have matched the criteria in your saved search in the last 24 hours. In this search, you might want to view the contact owner, the lead status, and the date they entered the pipeline.\n\nNow let's say you are a sales leader. You have asked your team to create a list of the contacts they will invite to an upcoming webinar. In this case, you might want your reps to view a table layout that includes contact status, SDR owner, account tier, and perhaps a custom field for subscription status.\n\nWhat If I'm Not an Admin?\n\nPlease note, you don't need admin access to create and apply custom layouts to your searches. However, only admin users can create public custom table layouts and access the \"table layouts\" tab in the settings. If you have a great idea for a new table layout for your entire team but don't have admin access, reach out to your team's admin users to make the magic happen.\n\nRefer to the sections below to create new custom layouts, manage your layouts in the settings, and apply a custom layout when prospecting.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Create a New Custom Layout from the Search Page[](#toc_3)\n\nThere's More than One Right Way!\n\nPsst\u2014you can also create a new custom layout from the settings page.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nDo you have trouble hearing the person you're talking to on the Apollo dialer? Is your audio cutting out? Are you unable to make a call using the dialer?\n\nThere are several issues related to hardware, software, and network connectivity that can impact your ability to use the Apollo dialer successfully. But fear not! Apollo is here to help.\n\nThe following sections provide step-by-step guidance for troubleshooting your dialer issues:\n\n*   [Step 1: Check Hardware](#step-1-check-hardware)\n*   [Step 2: Perform Basic Troubleshooting](#step-2-perform-basic-troubleshooting)\n*   [Step 3: Troubleshoot Specific Audio Issues](#step-3-troubleshoot-specific-audio-issues)\n*   [Step 4: Enable Call Debugging in Apollo](#step-4-enable-call-debugging-in-apollo)\n\n## Step 1: Check Hardware[](#toc_2)\n\nSoftware issues are often rooted in the hardware you use. Start by confirming that your hardware provides the resources that the dialer needs to function properly. Apollo recommends you use a computer with at least 16GB of RAM.\n\nApollo also recommends that you use a USB-based headset when making calls. The latency in a wireless headset can cause delays.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Perform Basic Troubleshooting[](#toc_3)\n\nWith your hardware confirmed to be performing adequately, you should perform some basic troubleshooting for your software, specifically your web browser and operating system settings.\n\n### Troubleshoot Web Browser[](#toc_4)\n\nYour web browser can consume too much RAM or cause other issues that result in poor connection quality. Try the following steps to improve your dialer connection:\n\n*   Confirm that only 1 instance of Apollo is open in your web browser.\n*   Close browser tabs that you don't need open. Too many open tabs can result in heavy resource use on your computer.\n*   Make sure your browser is up to date. If you use Chrome, enter `chrome://settings/help` in the address bar. This page displays whether Chrome is up-to-date or provides you with an option to update it. [![Chrome](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i2.png)\n    \n*   Clear your browser cache. If you use Chrome, enter `chrome://settings/privacy` in the address bar to view your browsing data. Then, click **Clear Browsing Data**.\n    \n\n[![Cache](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i3.png)\n\nClick the **Time range** drop-down and select **All Time**. Then, click **Clear data** to clear the cache.\n\n[![Cache_2](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i4.png)\n\n*   Perform a hard refresh on your browser with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+F5` for Windows PCs or `Command+Shift+R` for Macs. This clears the cache for a specific page.\n\nEven More Troubleshooting Options!\n\nTroubleshooting is not an exact science. Unfortunately, there are many ways in which your applications could stage a rebellion. Please read [Troubleshoot the Apollo Chrome Extension](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409227269389) for more tips on getting your applications back in your good graces.\n\n### Review Windows Network Settings[](#toc_5)\n\nIf your issues with the dialer are not related to your web browser, you should review your Windows network settings to ensure that Windows is allowing the needed network connections.\n\nThe 2 network settings that are most likely to interfere with the Apollo dialer are:\n\n*   Windows firewall\n*   VPN\n\n#### Windows Firewall[](#toc_6)\n\nIf you have enabled your Windows firewall, it can interfere with the Apollo dialer. You can either disable the firewall entirely or [whitelist Twilio's full IP and port ranges](#1).\n\nTo disable your Windows firewall:\n\n1.  Open **Control Panel**, then click **System and Security**. [![System and Security](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i5.png)\n2.  Click **Windows Defender Firewall**. [![Windows Defender Firewall](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i6.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i6.png)\n3.  Click **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off**. [![Windows Defender Firewall On Off](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i7.png)\n4.  Click **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall** for both private and public network settings. [![Turn Off Windows Defender Firewall](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_1/i8.png)\n\nWith your Windows firewall disabled, test your dialer connection again.\n\n**Whitelist Twilio's IP Ranges**\n\nIf you can't disable your Windows firewall, check your firewall configuration.\n\nYour firewall needs to give outgoing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) access to the public internet from the web browsers that use the dialer. The firewall also needs to allow return traffic in response.\n\nIf you are on a restricted network, you must whitelist [Twilio's full IP and port ranges](https://www.twilio.com/docs/global-infrastructure/firewall-configurations/programmable-voice-sdks).\n\nGoing Through Changes\n\nTwilio\u2014the third-party provider Apollo uses to integrate voice calls\u2014is updating its IP and port ranges. If you've enabled your firewall, you need to keep the old IP and port ranges open in your infrastructure until January 23, 2024. You also need to add the following new IP and port ranges:\n\n1.  Add 168.86.128.0/18 to your firewall rules.\n2.  Enable UDP from these IP addresses over ports 10000-60000.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve updated your network infrastructure, you need to enable your account's production traffic to use the IP ranges.\n\nFor more information about Windows firewall, please refer to the [Microsoft learning center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/).\n\n#### VPN Usage[](#toc_7)\n\nVPN usage might also affect which edge server Twilio uses to route traffic. This can add some latency to calls. For example, if you are in the US trying to make a call to the US without a VPN, Twilio uses an edge location in the US to route the call. However, if you use a VPN that connects you to a server in Australia for the same call, Twilio might route the call differently and negatively impact the call quality.\n\nIf you use a VPN, there are 2 options:\n\n*   Apollo recommends you disconnect from your VPN when making calls.\n*   If you cannot disconnect from your VPN, you need to coordinate with your engineering or IT team to allow Apollo permanent access via firewall and VPN rules.\n\nYou should also confirm that your antivirus software is not blocking Apollo and the dialer.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 3: Troubleshoot Specific Audio Issues[](#toc_8)\n\nIf you still have audio issues after checking your hardware, web browser, and network settings, you should troubleshoot based on the specific audio issue you are experiencing.\n\nThe following sections provide steps to take based on the specific nature of your audio problem.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Audio Cuts Out[](#toc_9)\n\nIf audio drops intermittently so that you have dead air, you are likely experiencing an unstable network connection. The dialer requires a high-speed, low-latency network connection.\n\nFirst, perform a [speed test](https://www.speedtest.net/) to verify your network connection speed. If your connection speed does not match what you pay for, talk to your internet service provider.\n\nIf your connection is on the slower side, follow these steps to improve your odds of a good dialer connection:\n\n*   When possible, use an ethernet cable for your internet connection rather than a WiFi connection. Wired connections are more reliable.\n*   Close tabs in your web browser. Tabs take up bandwidth.\n*   Exit any other programs that use bandwidth.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Unclear Audio[](#toc_10)\n\nIf you maintain a steady connection when using the dialer, but you experience a garbled or otherwise unclear audio connection, there are several potential issues to explore.\n\nFollow these steps to try to eliminate your poor audio experience:\n\n*   Use a wired headset instead of your built-in computer microphone. As with the internet connection itself, a wired connection will deliver a more reliable audio experience.\n*   Reduce ambient noise, such as nearby speakers or fans.\n*   To avoid audio clipping (a form of audio distortion), make sure your microphone isn't too close to your mouth.\n*   Adjust the microphone levels in your computer settings. Your input may be too loud.\n*   Ensure that your computer has sufficient memory to process the dialer. Apollo recommends that your computer have at least 16GB of RAM.\n*   Close any applications that you don't need during calls.\n*   Antivirus software can be resource-heavy. Try disabling your antivirus program while you make a call.\n\nStay Safe Out There!\n\nApollo does not recommend disabling your antivirus software unless it is a last resort to troubleshoot an issue. Keep your network and computers safe at all times.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### No Audio[](#toc_11)\n\nConfirm that both your hardware and software meet all of the dialer's requirements. If you check and there is still no audio when using the dialer, Apollo recommends the following steps:\n\n*   If you use an external headset, confirm you have attached your headset correctly.\n*   If you are using a wired headset, try plugging your headset into a different port. Ports can fail without any warning.\n*   Confirm you have selected the right device in your sound settings. For example, your computer's audio output might be set to your computer speakers, even when your external headset is connected to the computer.\n*   Try connecting a different external headset.\n*   The Apollo dialer integrates with Twilio. Run this [Twilio-provided test](https://networktest.twilio.com/?usenewvoiceips=true) to help pinpoint your issue. [![Twilio Test](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i1.png)\n*   Try a different web browser. If you use Chrome, try the dialer with Microsoft Edge or Firefox.\n    \n    Chrome Plated\n    \n    You can try a different browser to see if the behavior differs, but Apollo recommends you stick with Chrome so that you can take advantage of the [Apollo Chrome extension](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226637453).\n    \n*   Confirm you have given your web browser permission to play sound.\n    \n    If you are using Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/content/sound` and make sure you have enabled the **Sites can play sound** radio button. [![Chrome Sound Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i6.png) ](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i6.png)If you have customized which sites can and cannot play sound from your browser, verify that your computer has `https://www.apollo.io:443` listed in the **Allowed to play sound** section. [![Chrome Sound Settings](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i7.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i7.png)\n    \n*   Confirm you have given your web browser permission to use your microphone.\n    \n    If you are using Chrome, go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`. Verify that your computer has `https://www.apollo.io:443` listed in the **Allowed to use your microphone** section. [![Chrome Setting: Allowed](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i2.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i2.png)\n    \n\nIf `https://www.apollo.io:443` is listed under the **Not allowed to use your microphone** section:\n\n1.  Click the **Trash Can** icon to delete it from the list. [![Chrome Setting: Blocked](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i3.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i3.png)\n2.  Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`. Then, click **Sites can ask to use your microphone** under the **Default behavior** section. [![Enable Mic](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i4.png)\n3.  Follow the instructions in [Make and Receive VoIP Calls](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231421837). When you try to place a call, Chrome will ask permission to use your microphone. Click **Allow**. [![Allow Microphone](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i5.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/dialer_faq_2/i5.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### No Ring Tone; One-way Audio[](#toc_12)\n\nIf you do not hear a ringtone when using the dialer to make a call, or only one side of the call can hear audio, this is likely due to high post-dial delay (PDD). This means Twilio sent a connection request to the telecom operator, but it\u2019s taking a lot to respond.\n\nPDD is most likely caused by the caller and receiver being geographically far away from each other. This means it takes time to establish a connection between the 2 parties. Using a VPN can add to the delay when establishing the connection. If you use a VPN, there are 2 options:\n\n*   Apollo recommends you disconnect from your VPN when making calls.\n*   If you cannot disconnect from your VPN, you need to coordinate with your engineering or IT team to allow Apollo permanent access via firewall and VPN rules.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Ring Tone, but No Audio[](#toc_13)\n\nIf you hear a ring tone but no audio after the call is answered, the issue is most likely due to the telecom operator. Apollo recommends trying to make the call again later.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 4: Enable Call Debugging in Apollo[](#toc_14)\n\nIf the troubleshooting guidance in this article does not fix your issues, enable call debugging in Apollo and then contact the [Apollo Support team](https://www.apollo.io/contact-us).

{"text": "Overview\n\nDynamic variables enable you to personalize emails for individual contacts by leveraging Apollo's data and, in the case of [custom dynamic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409494161677), your own data research. Advanced dynamic variables are somewhat different from [basic dynamic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813) in that they allow for limited conditional logic.\n\nThis means advanced dynamic variables can provide a fallback if there's no data for a specific field for a contact. Conditional logic helps emails with variables send successfully, instead of failing if Apollo doesn't have the necessary data to fill the variable for a contact.\n\n[![Conditional Logic](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_advanced_snippets/i2.jpg)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_advanced_snippets/i2.jpg)\n\nThe following sections show how to use all of the different types of advanced dynamic variables supported in email templates.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Types of Advanced Dynamic Variables[](#toc_1)\n\nAdvanced dynamic variables come in several different flavors:\n\n*   [Empty Fallback](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables#toc_2)\n*   [Dynamic Fallback](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables#toc_3)\n*   [Letter Case and Pluralization Operators](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables#toc_4)\n*   [Now-date/Time Operators](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables#toc_5)\n*   [Custom Date Operators](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845-Use-Advanced-Dynamic-Variables#toc_6)\n\nEach of these advanced dynamic variable types enables you to further personalize email templates for your customers.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Empty Fallback[](#toc_2)\n\nUse the empty fallback advanced dynamic variable to send emails without fearing they won't send because a basic dynamic variable lacks data. With an empty fallback, your email sends with a blank space in place of the variable if Apollo doesn't have data for a contact.\n\nImagine you want to send an email that greets each recipient by their first name. You could use the `{{first_name}}` basic dynamic variable to say:\n\nGreetings {{first\\_name}},\n\nHowever, if Apollo doesn't have a first name for a contact in your sequence, the dynamic variable fails and Apollo moves your email to the [Not Sent](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5403737512589-Why-Didn-t-My-Email-Send#toc_9) folder.\n\nTo avoid this situation, use the advanced dynamic variable `{{#if first_name}}{{#endif}}` to create a generic fallback:\n\nGreetings {{#if first\\_name}}{{#endif}},\n\nIf Apollo has the data for an email recipient, the dynamic variable renders in the email:\n\nGreetings John,\n\nIf Apollo doesn't have the data, the email still sends with an empty space in place of the dynamic variable:\n\nGreetings ,\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Dynamic Fallback[](#toc_3)\n\nAdvanced dynamic variables with a dynamic fallback go a step further than the empty fallback variety. These dynamic variables insert text that you define in the event that there is no relevant data for a contact.\n\nImagine you want to use generic text if a recipient's first name is unavailable. To do that, use the following advanced dynamic variable to create a dynamic fallback:\n\nHi {{#if first\\_name}}{{first\\_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}},\n\nIf Apollo has the data for an email recipient, the first name renders in the email:\n\nHi John,\n\nIf Apollo doesn't have the necessary data, the email renders with `there` in place of the variable:\n\nHi there,\n\nIt's important to understand what each part of the dynamic variable does. The first part, `{{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}`, is the start of the conditional logic. It tells Apollo \"If there is a value for first name, render that first\\_name value in the opened email\". This is similar to the basic dynamic variable `{{first_name}}`, with the inclusion of an `{{#if}}` statement.\n\nThe next part,`{{#else}}there`, tells Apollo \"If no first name value is available for this contact, use the text `there` instead\".\n\nThe final part, `{{#endif}}`, tells Apollo that this is the end of the conditional logic for this dynamic variable.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Letter Case and Pluralization Operators[](#toc_4)\n\nAdvanced dynamic variables with letter case and pluralization operators take the value of a field and change the case or the pluralization.\n\nString Fields Only\n\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on `string` field types. They don't work for other field types.\n\nThe following examples show how letter case and pluralization operators can be used:\n\n| Dynamic Variables | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{{title->lowercase}}` | Takes the value of a contact's job title and converts every letter in it to lowercase. | `Engineering Manager` becomes `engineering manager` |\n| `{{title->capitalize_each_word}}` | Takes the value of a contact's job title and converts the first letter in every word to uppercase. | `engineering manager` becomes `Engineering Manager` |\n| `{{title->plural}}` | Takes the value of a contact's job title and converts it to the plural form. | `Engineering Manager` becomes `Engineering Managers` |\n\nAdd a `->` within the variable to combine multiple case and pluralization operators. For example, to convert a contact's job title to uppercase and plural form, combine the operators within the same variable:\n\n{{title->capitalize\\_each\\_word->plural}}\n\nThis dynamic variable renders the job title `engineering manager` as `Engineering Managers`.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Now-Date/Time Operators[](#toc_5)\n\nAdvanced dynamic variables with `{{now_month}}`, `{{now_day}}`, and `{{now_time}}` operators take the current date and manipulate it in various ways.\n\nDate-Type Fields Only\n\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on `date` field types. They don't work for other field types.\n\nThe following examples show how now-date and time operators can be used:\n\n| Dynamic Variables | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{{now_day->plus_X}}` | Takes the current day and moves it forward by the specified number of business days. If the number of business days exceeds the number of days in the current month, Apollo accounts for the transition and continues the count at the first day of the upcoming month. You can use any whole number (`integer`) here. | If today is the 15th day of the month and a Wednesday, the dynamic variable `{{now_day->plus_5}}` renders as `22` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_day->minus_X}}` | Takes the current day and moves it backward by the specified number of business days. If the number of business days exceeds the number of days in the current month, Apollo accounts for the transition and continues the count at the last day of the previous month. You can use any whole number (`integer`) here. | If today is the 15th day of the month and a Wednesday, the dynamic variable `{{now_day->minus_5}}` renders as `8` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_month->plus_X}}` | Takes the current month and moves it forward by the specified number of months. You can use any whole number (`integer`) between `1` and `11`. | If the current month is April, the dynamic variable `{{now_month->plus_1}}` renders as `May` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_month->minus_X}}` | Takes the current month and moves it backward by the specified number of months. You can use any whole number (`integer`) between `1` and `11`. | If the current month is April, the dynamic variable `{{now_month->minus_2}}` renders as `February` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_year->plus_X}}` | Takes the current year and moves it forward by the specified number of years. You can use any whole number (`integer`) here. | If the current year is 2024, the dynamic variable `{{now_year->plus_2}}` will render as `2026` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_year->minus_X}}` | Takes the current year and moves it backward by the specified number of years. You can use any whole number (`integer`) here. | If the current year is 2024, the dynamic variable `{{now_year->minus_1}}` will render as `2023` in the opened email. |\n| `{{now_time_of_day}}` | Displays the current time stage of the day (`morning`, `afternoon`, `evening`). | If the current time is 9:00am, the dynamic variable `Good {{now_time_of_day}},` renders as `Good morning,` in the opened email. |\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n### Custom Date Operators[](#toc_6)\n\nSelect Plans Only\n\nCustom fields and dynamic variables that leverage custom date operators are only available for customers on [certain Apollo plans](https://www.apollo.io/pricing). If you don't have access and would like to upgrade your plan, reach out to the [Apollo sales team](https://apollo.na.chilipiper.com/router/sales_router?leadsource=Inbound&lead_source_details__c=KnowledgeBase).\n\nAdvanced dynamic variables with custom date operators make use of custom fields configured for dates and manipulate them in various ways.\n\nDate-Type Fields Only\n\nThese advanced dynamic variable types only work on `date-type` field types. They don't work for other type fields.\n\nImagine you create a custom field called `product_announcement` for the date of your yearly product announcement that takes place on October 15, 2024. That custom field includes a month, day, and year, so you can use custom date operators in a dynamic variable to extract specific pieces.\n\nThe dynamic variable `{{product_announcement->day}}` renders as `15`, the dynamic variable `{{product_announcement->month}}` renders as `October`, and the dynamic variable `{{product_announcement->year}}` renders as `2024` in the opened email.\n\nIn addition, you could use the dynamic variable `{{product_announcement->weekday}}` to extract the day of the week for your custom date. In this instance, it renders as `Tuesday` in the opened email because October 15, 2024 is a Tuesday.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Example Use Case For Advanced Dynamic Variables[](#toc_7)\n\nFormatting For Clarity Only\n\nIn this example, the text is formatted to offset the dynamic variables from the plain-text copy, and line breaks are inserted between each conditional logic statement for ease of reading. You should write dynamic variables in Apollo as a single, continuous line.\n\nFor additional context, take a look at a real-world example of how to use advanced dynamic variables in your email template. Within an automatic email task, we created an email template with body copy that leverages several different advanced dynamic variable types.\n\n> Hi `{{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}}`,\n> \n> We know many companies like\n> \n> {{#if industry == Marketing}}Company 1\n> {{#else}}{{#if industry == Big Data}}Company 2\n> {{#else}}Company 3{{#endif}}{{#endif}}\n> \n> are looking for new tools to implement for `{{now_year->plus_1}}`, and we'd like to walk you through our platform so that you have a good understanding of our full capabilities. Does `{{now_weekday->plus_2}}` or `{{now_weekday->plus_3}}` `{{now_time_of_day}}` work for you?\n\n[![View the use of advanced dynamic variables.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_advanced_dynamic_variables/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/use_advanced_dynamic_variables/i1.png)\n\n**Use Case Explanation: Nested Dynamic Variables Pointing to Specific Field Values**\n\nThe `{{#if first_name}}{{first_name}}{{#else}}there{{#endif}}` dynamic variable sets up a fallback for the first name to render as `there` if there is no first name data available for the email recipient.\n\nThe `{{#if industry == Marketing}}Company 1` portion of the dynamic variable tells Apollo to render the text as `Company 1` if the **Industry** field for the email recipient is `Marketing`. If the industry is not `Marketing`, Apollo moves on to the next piece of conditional logic.\n\nThe `{{#else}}{{#if industry == Big Data}}Company 2` portion tells Apollo to render the text as `Company 2` if the **Industry** field for the email recipient is `Big Data`. If the **Industry** is not `Marketing` or `Big Data`, Apollo moves on to the fallback portion of the conditional logic.\n\nThe dynamic variable `{{#else}}Company 3` is the fallback if the email recipient's **Industry** field does not match `Marketing` or `Big Data`. In this instance, the text renders as `Company 3` in the opened email.\n\nThe final portion of the dynamic variable, `{{#endif}}{{#endif}}`, closes the conditional logic. Two `{{endif}}` statements are required because there are nested `{{#if}}` statements.\n\nHow many `{{endif}}` statements do I need?\n\nAs a general rule, for each `{{#if}}` statement in your dynamic variable, you need a corresponding `{{#endif}}` to close the dynamic variable.\n\n**Use Case Explanation: Now-Time Dynamic Variables**\n\nThe dynamic variable `{{now_year->plus_1}}` tells Apollo to take the current year `2024` and add 1 year to it. When the recipient opens this email, this variable renders as `2025`.\n\nThe dynamic variable `{{now_weekday->plus_2}}` tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance it by 2 days. If Apollo sends the email on a Monday, the text in the email renders as `Wednesday`. If Apollo sends this email on a Thursday, the text will render the dynamic variable as `Monday` because it is the next available weekday.\n\nThe `{{now_weekday->plus_3}}` dynamic variable tells Apollo to take the current day of the week and advance it by 3 days. If Apollo sends the email on a Tuesday, the text in the email will render as `Friday`. If Apollo sends the email on a Wednesday, the text renders as `Monday`. Apollo renders the dynamic variable as the next available business day if the day of the week specified by the dynamic variable falls on a weekend day.\n\nFinally, the `{{now_time_of_day}}` dynamic variable tells Apollo to display the current time stage of the day for the recipient based on their local time in their local timezone (when it is available) and renders `morning`, `afternoon`, or `evening`.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409735256845"}

They are sets of key account filters that you can apply to find and target the right types of companies faster. Account segments include filters like company location, number of employees, stage, revenue, buying intent, job postings, and much more.\n\nWhen you define the specific accounts that match your ideal customer profile, Apollo can narrow down the results in the data health center and show you the most relevant records for your company.\n\nClick **Create more account segments** to create and activate your core account segments in Apollo.\n\n[![Create more personas button](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_data_health_center/i10.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_data_health_center/i10.png)\n\nGive your account segment a name to make it easier to identify later.\n\n[![Name field in new account segment modal](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_data_health_center/i11.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/set_up_the_data_health_center/i11.png)\n\nThen, click the filter accordion next to the filters you want to apply to your account segment.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nInbound routers help you automate the process of scheduling meetings via Apollo and scale processes across teams and organizations. You can choose which meeting type your team's prospects can book based on their answers to your intake form. You can also redirect prospects to websites or present custom messages.\n\nAt an organization level, you as an Apollo admin can set up a single link that routes meetings across different teams or SDRs. This means prospects will always schedule meetings with the right people.\n\nAdmins Only!\n\nOnly Apollo admins can create inbound routers. Other users can be assigned meetings via inbound routers and view them, but cannot create them.\n\nCustomers on paid plans can create as many inbound routers as needed! If you are on a free plan, your organization's admins are limited to creating 3 inbound routers total across all admins.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 0: Before You Begin[](#toc_1)\n\nA key function of inbound routers is to route scheduled meetings to the appropriate teams or SDRs. Before setting up your inbound routers, [create the meeting types](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173) that you want to use for this purpose.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 1: Create Your Intake Form Template[](#toc_2)\n\nFor the intake form, you decide which questions you ask your prospects when they schedule a meeting with you. Then, the answers determine the rules and actions that apply to them later in this process.\n\nEach form template can be reused across your inbound routers as well as [round-robin meetings](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/9040988124173#toc_7). If you want to ask different prospects the same set of questions, add the same form template to the applicable routers.\n\n[![The Create Inbound Router screen.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i61.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i61.png)\n\nProspects Become Accounts and Contacts\n\nWhen a prospect submits your intake form, Apollo checks whether they are already a contact or account. If not, Apollo creates a contact/account with the information the prospect submitted.\n\nTo create your intake form template:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Meetings**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/inbound-routers).\n2.  Click **Create**, then **Intake forms**. [![Create your intake form.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i75.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i75.png)\n3.  Enter a name for your form template, then click **Create**.

By default, your intake form requires prospects to enter their name and email address. These fields cannot be removed from your form, but you can rename the question.\n    \n    To add more fields to the form, click **Add a question**. Choose from standard options such as company size and phone number, or create a custom question with your own input types. When choosing [routing options](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_4), responses to custom questions can be linked to [custom fields](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4412498754445) you've created in Apollo.\n    \n    If you choose **Single-select** or **Multi-select** as your input type for a custom question, you need to provide answers that the prospects can select. [![Add additional inputs for your intake form.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i62.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i62.png)\n    \n5.  (Optional) If you add a custom question, there are 3 separate choices you can make.\n    \n    First, if a contact or account does not already exist, Apollo automatically creates them when prospects submit your intake form. Choose an option from the **Apollo field** drop-down to map responses to a [custom contact field](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/contacts/custom_fields) in Apollo. If you set up the [Salesforce](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4414469523981) or [HubSpot](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4416606988941) integrations and adjusted the push settings, Apollo might also push the response to the CRM field that you mapped to the Apollo field. [![Map your fields and choose to make the question mandatory.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i70.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i70.png)  \n    Next, to make a question mandatory, toggle the **Set as required** option on. [![Make the question mandatory.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i71.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i71.png)  \n    Finally, to hide the question from the prospect, toggle the **Set as hidden** slider on. Then, enter a URL query parameter and default field value to track meetings booked via this link. The URL query parameter serves as a UTM tracking component in the meeting link URL.\n    \n    This option enables you to track important metrics related to how a meeting is booked. For example, if you are adding the meeting link to your company's Facebook page, you can set the URL query parameter to `facebook` to track the source.

Refer to [Deals Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415062467725) to learn how you can push Apollo deals to Salesforce to create opportunities.\n    \n6.  Click **Add** to save the intake form question.\n7.  When you have finished adding questions, click **Save**.\n\nRepeate these steps to create more form templates.\n\nTo edit or deactivate form templates, go to **Meetings** and click the [**Forms**](https://app.apollo.io/#/meetings/intake-forms) tab. You cannot change the status of a form template until it has been removed from any linked meeting types and inbound routers.\n\n[![Change form template status.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i68.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i68.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Step 2: Set Up a New Inbound Router[](#toc_3)\n\nTo set up an inbound router:\n\n1.

Go to the rules and actions section of the inbound router. Here, you can choose from the following options:\n    \n    \\-**If/else rule**: Create different Yes/No paths, with each path ending in a different action. For more details, refer to the [If/else Rule](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_5) section of this article.  \n    \\-**Ownership rule**: Create a Yes/No based on whether a prospect is already assigned to account owners or contact owners within Apollo. For more details, refer to the [Ownership Rule](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_6) section of this article.  \n    \\-**Book meeting**: End the path with the prospect scheduling a meeting. Choose from existing meeting types or create a new meeting type just for this path.  \n    \\-**Send to external url**: Redirect prospects to a landing page or other website of your choice. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.  \n    \\-**Display custom message**: Present prospects with a message that you craft. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.  \n    \\-**Default fallback**: Present prospects with a standard message across your inbound router. Use this option to display the same custom message to end multiple paths. Prospects do not have the option to schedule a meeting.\n    \n    [![Add rules and actions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i18.png)\n    \n2.  For this walkthrough, Apollo shows you the simplest route\u2014ending a path with prospects booking a meeting based on an existing meeting type.\n    \n    Click **Book meeting**, then **Link to existing meeting type**. [![Use an existing meeting type for your inbound router.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i25.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i25.png)\n    \n3.  Click the **Single-host meetings** tab if you want to send meetings to an individual. Click the **Shared meetings** tab to route to meetings with round robin or multi-host formats. Then, find and select the specific meeting type you want to use to schedule meetings. [![Choose between single-host and shared meetings.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i39.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i39.png)\n4.  Review the details of the meeting type. Then, click **Add to router**. [![Add the meeting type to your router.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i40.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i40.png)\n5.  Review your inbound router to ensure everything looks good. Then, click **Publish** to activate the router. [![Publish your inbound router.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i41.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i41.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## If/else Rule: Automate Your Meeting Routing[](#toc_5)\n\nWhen creating inbound routers, the if/else rule is a powerful option that you can use to route prospects to different end actions based on their answers to the intake form questions.\n\nThe if/else rule creates yes/no paths, and you decide how each path ends based on whether a prospect's answers meet the criteria you set. For example, let's say you add the company size question to your intake form and you want to route prospects to different hosts based on their responses.\n\nTo do so:\n\n1.  When you add rules and actions, click **If/else rule**. [![Add rules and actions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i18.png)\n2.  Click the respond type drop-down and choose **Company size**. Select an option from the value drop-down and decide whether your rule will match that value. Then, click **Save**.\n    \n    For this example, Apollo selected **is** and **5000+**. This means the yes path is for respondents that chose 5000+ as the answer and the no path is for everyone else. [![Add rules and actions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i20.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i20.png)\n    \n3.  To finish each of your paths, select **Add rule/action**. Choose from the [routing options](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_4). If you want to create more yes/no paths, add another if/else rule.

Review your inbound router to ensure everything looks good. Then, click **Publish** to activate the router.\n\nThe if/else rule follows similar logic regardless of the input question. This means you can follow these steps to create inbound routers based on your needs. The following image shows what is possible when you add more paths.\n\n[![Add more complex paths to your router.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i35.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i35.png)\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Ownership Rule: Route Prospects to Account/Contact Owners[](#toc_6)\n\nThe ownership rule enables you to route prospects to their existing account/contact owners in Apollo. Use this option to create a single yes/no path. The yes path always ends with the prospect scheduling a meeting with the appropriate account/contact owner.\n\nWith the ownership rule, Apollo checks the email address that a prospect enters in your intake form to determine the routing. If the email address is owned by an account/contact owner, the prospect follows the yes path and is able to book a meeting with that account/contact owner.\n\nTo use the ownership rule:\n\n1.  When you add rules and actions, click **Ownership rule**. [![Add rules and actions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i44.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i44.png)\n2.

(Optional) By default, all of your account/contact owners are added, which means prospects with a matching domain can book a meeting with them. If you don't want owners to be available via this path, toggle the slider off for them. [![Choose which account or contact owners are available.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i48.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/create_inbound_routers_for_your_meetings/i48.png)\n4.  (Optional) By default, Apollo sets the same standard meeting type for all account/contact owners under the ownership rule's yes path. The location of the meeting type (Zoom or Google Meet) is determined by the individual user's settings.\n    \n    To change the details of standard meeting type for all owners, select the **pencil** icon in the default meeting type section. To instead set meeting types individually, select an option from the **Meeting** drop-down for each owner.

Click **Save**. This creates your yes path. All prospects that are identified as matching an eligible account/contact owner will be able to schedule a meeting based on the options you selected.\n6.  To finish your no path, select **Add rule/action** and choose from the [routing options](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/17919970244109#toc_4).

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nWhen you integrate a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce, Apollo lists the default contact and account fields you can map to the CRM. Fields that you do not map will not sync across Apollo and the CRM, so you should map all default fields to avoid data discrepancies. Additionally, mapping more default fields means your data will be more complete across both systems.\n\nTo help with the field mapping process, Apollo offers recommendations for both [contact fields](#toc_2) and [account fields](#toc_3). You are not required to follow these recommendations.\n\nThe following sections detail where you can map default fields and Apollo's recommendations for field mapping.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Access the Default Fields[](#toc_1)\n\nTo find default contact fields for mapping:\n\n1.

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_0)\n\nSequences are outreach campaigns with any number of sequential contact points and tasks that you can customize to personally engage your target audiences at scale. There are several types of steps available in Apollo sequences, including the ability to complete tasks in LinkedIn.\n\nThe benefits of using LinkedIn steps in a sequence include:\n\n*   **Personalization at scale**: Create templates for connection requests and InMail messages and personalize your approach with [snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093) and [dynamic variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813-Use-Basic-Snippets%E2%80%9D%20target=).\n*   **Streamlined workflow**: Access a contact's LinkedIn profile with one click and document key information with ease.\n*   **Improved performance**: Keep track of every task you execute and leave suggestions and prompts that can help you increase engagement.\n\nBe Accountable\n\nYou need a LinkedIn account to see any information about a contact. You can use a different email account for your Apollo account and LinkedIn account.\n\nClick [here](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-join) to create a new LinkedIn account. To learn more about how to prospect with LinkedIn, read the [Prospect in LinkedIn](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409229262093-Prospect-in-LinkedIn) article.\n\nThe following sections detail the LinkedIn tasks available to you in sequences and how to use them to track your LinkedIn prospecting efforts.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Understand the LinkedIn Tasks[](#toc_1)\n\nThere are 4 LinkedIn tasks you can use in your sequence. These steps create a task in Apollo that can be auto-executed from [Tasks](https://app.apollo.io/#/tasks) and the [Apollo Chrome extension](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409226637453). The steps include:\n\n*   **View Profile**: View a contact's LinkedIn profile to gain specific information such as education history, job history, current company details, and colleagues. When executed, this step takes you to the LinkedIn's profile and marks the task as completed.\n*   **Interact with Post**: Interact with a contact's posts on LinkedIn. When executed, this step takes you to the activity section of a contact's LinkedIn profile and marks the task as completed. Then, you can manually interact with a contact's LinkedIn post.\n*   **Send Connection Request**: Connection requests allow you to direct message a contact and, in some cases, are necessary to see and interact with the contact's posts. When executed, this step automatically sends a connection request to a contact and, if it succeeds, marks the task as completed. You can send connection requests with or without a message.\n*   **Send Message**: When executed, this step sends a direct message to a contact and, if it succeeds, marks the task as complete. A contact must be a connection on LinkedIn before a message can be sent to them, so this should be the last step in developing a relationship with a contact through LinkedIn. You only want to message a contact if you are sure they would like to speak with you. Otherwise, it will feel like spam.\n\nWhen you choose to **Send Connection Request** or **Send Message**, you can create a template. You can also use snippets and dynamic variables to personalize outreach to your contacts. For more on snippets, refer to [Create and Edit Snippets](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/11509551262093). For more on dynamic variables, refer to [Use Basic Dynamic Variables](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409415084813).\n\nExecuting too many LinkedIn tasks at the same time can lead to your account being marked as a bot. LinkedIn temporarily restricts your account if you send too many invitations within a short amount of time, or if too many of your invitations\u00a0have been ignored, left pending, or marked as spam by the recipients. Please be cautious and restrict the number of invites you send.\n\nTypes of Sequence Steps\n\nFor more information about the available step types in a sequence, please refer to the **Available Steps in a Sequence** section of [Sequences Overview](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409237165837).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Add LinkedIn Tasks to Existing Sequences[](#toc_2)\n\nShiny and New\n\nIf you prefer to add LinkedIn steps to a new sequence instead, refer to [Create a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409231193101).\n\nWhen you combine prospecting with LinkedIn and the ability to track tasks with sequences, you can reach your goals easier. You can track each step of your LinkedIn prospecting process by adding tasks to your existing sequences in Apollo. To do so:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n2.  Click the sequence that you want to update. [![Update your sequence.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i12.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i2.png)\n3.  Click **Add a step**.

Define the amount of time that Apollo should wait before triggering this step when the previous step is complete as well as the priority of the task. You can also add notes about the task.\n    \n    Use the advanced settings option if you want to automatically skip tasks after the due date.\n    \n    Then, click **Complete**. [![Choose a task to add.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i15.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i15.png)\n    \n\nThe LinkedIn task is now added to your sequence. To rearrange the steps in your sequence, drag and drop a step to a different spot.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Add Contacts to Your Sequence[](#toc_3)\n\nNow that you have your LinkedIn steps in your sequence, you should add contacts. The contacts you add will run through your LinkedIn sequence.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions on how to add contacts to a sequence, refer to [Add Contacts to a Sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence).\n\nOne at a Time\n\nBe aware that a contact should only be in 1 sequence at a time.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Execute LinkedIn Tasks in Your Sequence[](#toc_4)\n\nWith a contact added to your sequence, you can use your LinkedIn tasks to guide yourself through engagement. You do need to be logged in to your LinkedIn Account to execute your LinkedIn tasks.\n\nTo execute LinkedIn tasks in your sequence:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click [**Sequences**](https://app.apollo.io/#/sequences).\n2.  Confirm your sequence is toggled on, then click your sequence to access it. [![Check that your sequence is enabled.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i1.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i1.png)\n3.

Go to [**Tasks**](https://app.apollo.io/#/tasks).\n5.  Click the checkbox for each task that you want to execute, then click the **Execute tasks** icon. You will be taken to LinkedIn where the task will be automatically completed. If a contact does not have a LinkedIn profile, the task will not execute. [![Execute your LinkedIn tasks.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i17.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i17.png)\n\nYou have now executed the LinkedIn tasks in your sequence. A message from Apollo appears in LinkedIn to confirm the tasks have been completed.\n\n[![View completed Apollo tasks.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i18.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/linkedin_tasks_sequence/i18.png)\n\nYou can repeat this process for each task until the LinkedIn sequence is complete.\n\nSkipping Stones\n\nYou are not beholden to any of the tasks you create. You can skip any task that you do not want to complete.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Troubleshoot LinkedIn Task Errors[](#toc_5)\n\nIf Apollo encounters a problem executing a task for a specific contact, you will see an error icon in the tasks queue pop-up next to the contact's name.\n\n[![Error icon in tasks queue pop-up.](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/automate_linkedin_tasks/i8.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/automate_linkedin_tasks/i8.png)\n\nThere are a few reasons why you might encounter an error when executing a LinkedIn task:\n\n*   You have attempted to execute a send message task before the contact has accepted your LinkedIn request. Apollo can only send messages to contacts that are already part of your LinkedIn network. If you see this error, try executing the task later once the contact has accepted your request to connect.\n*   You use Sales Navigator. Unfortunately, Apollo's LinkedIn automation does not currently support automation for send message tasks if you have an active Sales Navigator subscription.\n*   LinkedIn temporarily restricts your account if you send too many invitations within a short amount of time, or if too many of your invitations\u00a0have been ignored, left pending, or marked as spam by the recipients.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5646233248269"}

{"text": "## Overview[](#toc_1)\n\nWhile you can always manually map stages between Apollo and Salesforce, you can also use automapping to make the job easier. If an unmapped stage in Apollo matches an unmapped value in Salesforce, then Apollo automatically maps the two together. Additionally, for Salesforce values that don\u2019t have a matching stage in the platform, Apollo will create one for you.\n\nApollo will not overwrite any mappings you created before running the auto-mapping feature. Apollo will only automatically map stages that are not already mapped.\n\nRefer to the sections below to automatically map contact, lead, or account fields from Salesforce to stages in Apollo. Keep in mind that the process for automatically mapping stages is the same for all record types.\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Automatically Map Stages[](#toc_2)\n\nTo automatically map your Apollo stages to your Salesforce fields:\n\n1.  Launch Apollo and click the [integrations icon](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/integrations).

You will see a modal with additional details about how Apollo automatically creates and maps stages. When you're ready to start the process, click **Proceed**.

If an unmapped value from a Salesforce field matches an existing stage, but that stage is already mapped to a different value, Apollo will not map the Salesforce field to the existing stage. Apollo will also not attempt to create a new stage and match the two together since that would incorrectly create a duplicate for an existing stage.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Stage Mapping Best Practices[](#toc_3)\n\nTo prevent stage mapping errors between Salesforce and Apollo:\n\n1.  **Map all stages 1:1.**\n\n*   Map each stage in your CRM to a corresponding stage in Apollo.\n*   Don't map more than one stage to the same field in Salesforce.\n\n3.  **Make sure the stage name matches.**\n\n*   This is very important to remember if you plan to [automatically create and map stages](https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/contacts/stages). However, you can also manually map stages that don't share the same name.\n\n5.  **Stay on top of housekeeping.**\n\n*   Delete old or unused stages.\n*   Move the contacts from the old stages into the correct, active, mapped stage.\n\nNever Stop Learning!\n\nNeed a splash more of Salesforce guidance?

It is unlikely that there will ever be a time when you can just sit back and admire your work. In order to keep up with changing customer demand, emerging technologies, and potential blockers to your success, you need to constantly revisit, analyze, and improve your process.\n\nAt Apollo, we\u2019ve adopted the **ABE** mantra, \u201cAlways Be Experimenting.\u201d And while this is a somewhat tired and overwrought trope, it has persisted for so long because there is merit to this method. There are a number of key factors that you should keep in mind as you experiment and revise your approach, some of which include adjusting techniques, confirming the validity of your metrics, avoiding SPAM filters, and choosing the right approach for your business.\n\nThe sections below provide more context about some additional strategies you can take to improve your outbound sales process.\n\n## ABE: Always Be Experimenting[](#toc_2)\n\nSticking with the same outbound strategy for a prolonged period of time is likely to yield diminishing returns. Customer needs and demands change frequently and you need to remain agile to stay ahead of the curve. Here are a few best practices you should consider as you experiment with your outbound sales strategy:\n\n*   Test a different combination of targets/segments and messaging every day with a sample size of about 200 contacts.\n*   Check your metrics/analytics every day.\n    *   If your **Open Rate** is less than 30%-40%, you may have a problem with your targets or email subject lines.\n    *   If your **Interested Rate** is less than 0.5%, you may have an issue with your targets or your email messaging.\n*   **Open Rate** and **Interested Rate** are most important to consider when you are looking for incremental improvement\n*   Tweak your campaign with different messaging as needed or run a new campaign with different targeting and messaging to compare the outcomes.\n*   Utilize Apollo\u2019s robust Reporting and Dashboards so you can view all of the important information for your **Sequences** at a glance.\n    *   The **Business Performance Overview** dashboard comes pre-built with Apollo and is a great starting point.\n\nUltimately, testing new things every day helps you to learn about your customer base and incrementally improve your overall analytics/data system.\n\n## Avoid Getting SPAM Blocked[](#toc_3)\n\nThere is no magic bullet for avoiding SPAM blockers entirely, but there are a few different tactics you can employ to help limit their impact on your outbound email campaigns. If you notice that your email **Open Rate** has dropped to 10% or lower, SPAM filters are likely blocking your messages before they even reach a contact\u2019s inbox.\n\nEveryone Is Different!\n\nPlease note, the tips and guidelines below are only meant to serve as best practices and can in no way guarantee that you will eliminate all instances of SPAM blocked emails. SPAM filtering is user-specific\u2014if someone marks an email as spam, their email service provider's spam filtering will update itself to catch similar emails in the future. Two people can receive the same email and encounter different filtering behavior.\n\nThe following list provides some additional considerations for email body content:\n\n*   **Remove Links from the Body of Your Email:** SPAM filters look for links, especially in first-contact emails. They also scan your signature for links as well. Make sure you've removed links from your signature as well as in the body of your emails.\n*   **Remove Images from the Body of Your Email:** Images or attachments, especially in first-contact emails, can activate SPAM blockers and cause bounces. Remove these assets and stick to text. Save your images and attachments for Step 3 or later in your sequence once you've sent a few other emails. As with links, even images in your signature can cause issues.\n*   **Don't Apply Special Formatting to Your Text:** Simply put, SPAM blockers scan for formatted text. Avoid using different colors, fonts, bolding, italicization, and underlining.\n*   **Keep Your Paragraphs Concise:** Lengthy content can activate SPAM blockers or even cause bounces. Keep your wording simple and to the point.\n*   **Avoid Words that Trigger SPAM Filters:** SPAM filters have evolved considerably in the past few years, and as such, there isn't a shortlist of words to avoid. In general, try to communicate in a professional, personable way and avoid words and phrases that sound suspicious, urgent, or needy. This\u00a0[**HubSpot article**](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30684/the-ultimate-list-of-email-spam-trigger-words.aspx)\u00a0provides a comprehensive list of words or phrases that you should avoid. As a best practice, ask yourself if the email you intend to send is one you would want to receive yourself.\n*   **A/B Test Your Messaging:** Always test out your messaging to find what results in the highest engagement. You can A/B test in Apollo to try multiple versions of a similar message. If you find one version is blocked at a higher rate, you can look at the differences in your messaging to try to understand the cause.\n*   **Include\u00a0an Unsubscribe Link\u00a0in Your Email Signature:** Apollo allows you to use whatever text/phrase you'd prefer in an opt-out link and automatically adds the link with your signature on all of the emails you send through the platform. Research shows that recipients are far more likely to use an unsubscribe link instead of marking your emails as SPAM. Marking your emails as SPAM can affect your overall sending reputation and is, therefore, a much worse outcome.\n*   **Deactivate Click Tracking:** Click tracking manipulates links in emails, which SPAM filters can sometimes detect. Disable this feature if you're having issues by deactivating it in each user's profile. For additional information, please see the \"[**Click Tracking in Apollo**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409803614093)\" article.\n*   **Deactivate Open Tracking: T**he same technology for open and click tracking is usually very sensitive to filters in email servers. This makes them more susceptible to SPAM blockers. If this is something you've struggled with and you have followed the instructions provided above as best practice, you may want to consider disabling open tracking. For additional information, please see the \"[**Open Tracking Overview**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4410838798349)\" article.\n\nGoogle has a great guide available on their Gmail Help site called \u201c[**Prevent mail to Gmail users from being blocked or sent to spam**](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en).\" Consider reviewing this if you plan to email Gmail users. We also have extensive technical documentation on the Knowledge Base to provide you with details and techniques to avoid email servers flagging your emails as SPAM or harming your domain reputation.\n\n*   [**Avoid SPAM Filters**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409225311885-Avoid-SPAM-Filters)\n*   [**Set Up Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) to Authenticate Your Emails**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046576375437-Set-Up-Domain-based-Message-Authentication-Reporting-and-Conformance-DMARC-to-Authenticate-Your-Emails)\n*   [**Set Up Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) to Authenticate Your Email**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046544644365-Set-Up-Domain-Keys-Identified-Mail-DKIM-to-Authenticate-Your-Email)\n*   [**Set Up Sender Policy Framework (SPF) Records to Authorize Your Emails**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046457454861-Set-Up-Sender-Policy-Framework-SPF-Records-to-Authorize-Your-Emails)\n\n### Warm Up Your Domain[](#toc_4)\n\nThere may be many different reasons why you move to a new email domain, but all of them require you to build credibility and \u201cwarm-up\u201d your domain before you can send out emails en masse.\n\nEmail delivery services such as Google and Microsoft always monitor the rate at which their users send messages in order to prevent spammers from abusing their services. While they have traditionally only looked at the number of messages their users send per hour and per day, many services are now looking at how many messages users send per minute as well.\n\nFor example,\u00a0[**Google Suite's hard limits**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en)\u00a0are 400 emails per hour and 2000 emails per rolling 24-hour period. This means they never allow any of their users to send more than that number of emails via an individual mailbox.\n\nDomain warming helps you to establish a sending reputation for a domain that is brand new or has not been used to send email in a long time. This process requires you to start with a lower volume of sent emails and gradually increase that volume at each interval (whether that\u2019s a day or a week). To do this, send a reasonable volume of emails with a low amount of bounces and SPAM complaints. Over time, you will develop a better reputation with your email service provider and you can send a higher volume of emails without having your account rate limited or suspended.\n\nRate Limits!?\n\nIf you are rate limited or suspended by your email service provider, it means that you've sent too much bad content or too many emails per day or hour. You should immediately lower your sending limits in Apollo, edit the content of any emails you're sending that received a high rate of SPAM complaints, and follow any further instructions given by your email provider to get back in their good graces.\n\n### Use Alternate Domains and Employ White Labeling[](#toc_5)\n\nSetting up multiple domains for your outbound sales outreach helps to reduce the load on your primary mail server. It also helps to preserve your domain reputation when you need to send a higher volume of emails than your ESP allows.\n\nFor example, Apollo may send emails from one of the following servers for the same outreach campaign:\n\n*   `apollo.io`\n*   `tryapollo.io`\n*   `apollomail.io`\n\nWhite labeling your domain improves your deliverability and Email Service Provider (ESP) reputation. A [**Sender Policy Framework** (**SPF**)](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046457454861-Set-Up-Sender-Policy-Framework-SPF-Records-to-Authorize-Your-Emails) lets you specify the mail servers that you authorize to send emails for your domain and helps to prevent against domain spoofing. This helps your recipients (and more specifically, their ESP) identify potential phishing or fraudulent messages that appear to come from your company. [**DomainKeys Identified Mail Standard**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5046544644365-Set-Up-Domain-Keys-Identified-Mail-DKIM-to-Authenticate-Your-Email) (**DKIM**) is a similar security measure that helps to prevent spammers from impersonating your domain when they reach out to your prospects. You can configure **DKIM** in your domain provider\u2019s DNS settings to sign your emails with a unique signature that allows a recipient\u2019s server to verify that the sender is really you and that the message was not altered after you sent it.\n\nBlame the Mail Server!\n\nThe information you need to configure\u00a0**SPF**,\u00a0**DMARC**,\u00a0and\u00a0**DKIM**\u00a0is specifically related to your own domain and is not in any way related to Apollo. Apollo doesn't have email servers so all emails are sent directly from your email provider. Instructions to configure\u00a0**SPF**,\u00a0**DMARC**,\u00a0and\u00a0**DKIM**\u00a0vary by domain provider. You should contact your domain provider directly to obtain this information and receive any support that you need.\n\n### Start With A Lower Daily Volume and Gradually Ramp Up[](#toc_6)\n\nSending limits for emails may seem counter-intuitive to your goals, but the limits set in Apollo help protect your email accounts. Whether you send through Apollo or not, your email provider limits the number of emails that you can send if they suspect you of spamming large amounts of people that you don't know.\n\nMore on Rate Limits!?\n\nPlease note, the daily/hourly limits monitored by your email provider include all emails from the mailbox and through other connected tools (like Apollo). If you send a high volume of emails from your email client, you should lower your limits in Apollo.\n\nWhenever you start a new campaign that includes any kind of A/B testing, you should start with a lower daily volume. After you have data to support your targeting and messaging (typically, **Interested Rates** that are higher than 0.5% and ideally greater than 1%), you can consider increasing email volume and including more contacts in your outreach.\n\nGenerally, in the Apollo platform, we advise that you stick with the default mailbox setting of 400 emails per day and 100 per hour. If you want to increase the sending limits, you should do so gradually.\n\n*   **Daily Limit**: Increase by no more than 100 each week until you reach 1500 emails/day. You should never go beyond this limit if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\n*   **Hourly Limit**:\u00a0Increase by no more than 20 each week until you reach 400 emails/hour. Never go beyond 400 emails/hour if you're linked to a regular business mailbox.\n\n### Use Custom Tracking Subdomains[](#toc_7)\n\nA\u00a0**Tracking Domain**\u00a0is a secondary (or sub) domain name related to your original domain. It allows Apollo to redirect a tracking pixel added to emails to track opens, clicks, and unsubscribes.\n\nTracking pixels are often flagged as SPAM. To improve the delivery rates for the emails you send through Apollo, you can set up a custom\u00a0**Tracking Subdomain**. This can be a somewhat technical process and is best undertaken by someone like an IT professional who understands the intricacies involved in the process.\n\nFor more details about how to set up a tracking subdomain, check out our \u201c[**Set Up a Custom Tracking Subdomain (URL)**](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415240542733-Set-Up-a-Custom-Tracking-Subdomain-URL-)\u201d article.\n\n### Integrate Third-Party Tools Like Sendgrid/Mailgun[](#toc_8)\n\nTools like Sendgrid and Mailgun allow you to send a higher volume of emails that can bypass the regular sending limits imposed by major email providers. These kinds of tools help to take some of the pressure off of you when you are considering domain reputation and are warming up your domain.\n\nMore specifically, **SendGrid**\u00a0allows you to send up to 6000 emails per day and 500 emails per hour. If you plan to send a high volume of emails each day, a tool like Sendgrid or Mailgun is extremely beneficial.\n\n## High Volume vs. High Touch[](#toc_9)\n\nDifferent types of customers require different levels of interaction to close deals. It\u2019s important to consider the amount of manual effort you will need to take with each customer. You should then weigh that level of involvement and time against the contract value of a particular customer.\n\nA few of the approaches you may consider, in order of lowest touch to highest touch:\n\n*   Automatic emails only\n*   Automatic and manual emails\n*   Automatic and manual emails and phone calls\n\nBefore you decide on the right approach for your company, consider all of the factors below as you design your outbound sales process.\n\n### Consider the Size of Your ICP Segment[](#toc_10)\n\nSales teams can vary just as much as individual customers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that works for everyone. Ultimately, you should take a look at size and bandwidth and choose the approach that makes the most sense for your team.\n\nIt goes without saying that higher touch often yields better results because you can personalize each touchpoint for each contact to best suit their needs. However, this may not always be possible, especially when you\u2019re working with hundreds or thousands of potential contacts in a segment.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you\u2019ve got a large segment with hundreds of prospects, using a more automated approach may work best for you\u2014especially if you have a small team with limited resources. If your segment ends up on the smaller side (fewer than 100 contacts), as time permits, you may want to incorporate more manual emails into your strategy. People respond better to things that feel like they are worth their time. Highly individualized messaging can go a long way in bridging this gap.\n\n### Consider Your Deal Economics[](#toc_11)\n\nThe size and popularity of a prospect account may ultimately play into your outbound sales strategy. Typically, larger businesses mean higher potential contract values, but more manual engagement.\n\nDoes your business have a particular strategy for the type of companies you go after? Are you more focused on smaller, faster to close deals or does your business rely on large scale deals that may take months to close?\n\nIf you\u2019re primarily focused on closing larger deals, you can expect more manual, hands on interactions with your prospects, while smaller deals may allow for more automization. You may want to send manual emails or follow up with phone calls for higher-value deals and other scenarios that may necessitate it.\n\n### Consider How \u201cHard to Get\u201d Your Audience May Be[](#toc_12)\n\nFortune 500 companies (and other large scale companies) are very much a part of the public sphere and receive a large influx of marketing emails every single day. A SVP-Level contact at a Fortunate 500 company is a lot less likely to open (and even less likely to respond) a mass email that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\n\nOn the flip side, a manager at an SMB is unlikely to receive as many marketing emails. They may also be more likely to open one that is not entirely tailored to their pain points and needs.\n\nKeep in mind, you might need to evolve your strategy as you go. Analyze your results on a daily basis to find new patterns to improve your outreach. These are not hard and fast rules. You will need to observe the specific trends of your business to make the most informed decision for your sales strategy.\n\n## Wrap It Up[](#toc_13)\n\n[![Next Steps](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/apollo-public-assets/kb_images/academy/i4.png)\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned lots of techniques to shape your outbound sales strategy, it\u2019s time to get out there and start building your own from the ground up. Remember, this is always going to be a work in progress\u2014techniques that worked for you last year, last month, or even yesterday may not work tomorrow. Don\u2019t be afraid to reevaluate and restrategize every step of the way. Data is your friend. Keeping a close eye on it will help you to stay ahead of the trends and shifts in your customer segments.", "source": "https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/5120283466509-Build-an-Outbound-Sales-Process-Additional-Considerations"}

Apollo frees up their paid seat. You can then invite another user to take their place. Please only continue with the downgrade if you agree with the seat change.\n*   If you change a billing and seat manager into a full Apollo user when you don't have any available seats remaining on your plan, Apollo charges you for the extra seat. Apollo warns you of the purchase and confirms the cost. Please only continue with the upgrade if you agree with the seat change.\n*   If you change a billing and seat manager into a full Apollo user when you have available seats in your plan, Apollo upgrades the user to full access at no extra cost. Apollo warns you of the seat consumption. Please only continue with the upgrade if you agree with the seat change.\n*   If you deactivate a billing and seat manager, no changes to your billing will occur.

Unused credits expire at the end of your billing cycle. It pays to be organized! Make sure you take full advantage of your new plan from the first month by making changes in sync with the dates of your billing cycle.\n    \n3.  Click **Upgrade** to confirm the purchase.

You have now removed a contact from a sequence.\n    \n    Easy Does it!\n    \n    Please note, when you remove a contact from a sequence you agree to bypass the safety checks that notify you if you are about to re-deploy the contact to the same or another sequence, or to more than one sequence at a time. Apollo recommends you use your power with caution! If a contact replies to an email or unsubscribes, Apollo recommends you mark them as finished instead. Refer to the following section for further instructions.\n    \n    **(Reminder)** If you remove a contact from a sequence and then re-add them, Apollo remembers their progress and adds them back to the same step in the sequence. If you want the contact you removed to start from step 1 again, you need to [clone that sequence](https://knowledge.apollo.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409396985741-Add-Contacts-to-a-Sequence#toc_3) first and then add the contact to the newly cloned one instead.\n    \n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Manually Mark a Contact as Finished in a Sequence[](#toc_3)\n\nBy default, sequences end when a contact replies to an email. However, there are certain situations when you may want to manually mark a contact as finished.

{"text": "## Sync Mailboxes with UIDValidity[](#toc_1)\n\nApollo uses a third-party service called Nylas to connect custom mailboxes to your account. Nylas uses UIDValidity to sync mailboxes on their end. Some configurations lead to inconsistent UIDValidity, which affects sync consistency.\n\nIf the UIDValidity of your mailbox changes, Nylas attempts to resync the original value until too many failures cause it to stop. When this happens to a mailbox that you've synced with Apollo, Nylas disconnects it.\n\nTwo easy ways to prevent this from happening are:\n\n*   Ensure each folder in your email account has at least one message in it\n*   Delete all empty folders in your email account\n\nUIDValidity Guide\n\nFor more information on UIDValidity, read Nyla's [UIDValidity Guide](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/support/troubleshooting/uidvalidity/#inconsistent-uidvalidity-value).\n\n[Back to Top](#top)\n\n## Changes to Your Linked Mailbox that Effect Your Apollo Mailbox Settings[](#toc_2)\n\nIf Apollo can't authenticate your email account's login credentials, Apollo removes the mailbox.
